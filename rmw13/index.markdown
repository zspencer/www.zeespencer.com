Thanks for listening to Computer, Program Thyself.

If you have correcting or reinforcing feedback, I'd love to hear it! Post a

### My Takeaways

#### Drawing the presentation was interesting/fun
I got a lot of feedback about how much people enjoyed the drawing and presenting.
Especially the sound effects. I'll see if I can keep that in future talks. I had
a lot of fun preparing it and giving it; but I was super nervous since I'd never
done it before.

#### Energy was contagious/engaging, but slow down!
I spoke quickly and had a lot of energy. I got a nice set of reinforcing
feedback about how it was good to start the day with that kind of energy.

I also got a bit of correcting feedback that my speed was a bit too frenetic to
follow.  Both are legit.


#### Provide Useful Applications of Generative Programming
I spoke a lot in hypotheticals and analogy. Providing concrete examples of how
Generative Programming has helped solve real problems would be useful.

Unfortunately most practical applications in this field are under NDA. (Defense
contracts, financial industry, any highly-algo-dependent businesses).

I'll poll my sources to find good examples that are free to share.

#### Uh, Coad Plz?
I did avoid the code at this point. I was hoping to be able to get into it but
every time I did it caused the talk to balloon from 30 minutes to an hour and a
half. The code behind making this happen is not trivial by any means. I'm hoping
to make more improvements there over time.

#### Y U NO TAEK QUESTIONS?!
That's my fault. I could cut an additional 5 minutes from the talk
by removing the stuff about how societies learn and quite a bit of the risk
management pieces. I feel like those are both really important points, but maybe
not for this specific presentation.


Thank you all for the feedback!
