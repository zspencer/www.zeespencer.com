HEY YA'LL! Sorry you had to suffer through my talk.

If you want to leave feedback, I'd appreciate it. Here's my profile on
[SpeakerRate](http://speakerrate.com/talks/21341-computer-program-thyself)

Oh, and here's a [PDF of the slides]({{ 'presentations/computer-program-thyself.pdf' | asset_path }}).

Here are the take-aways for the next revision of this talk:

#### Provide Useful Applications of Generative Programming
I spoke a lot in hypotheticals and analogy. Providing concrete examples of how
Generative Programming has helped solve real problems would be useful.

Unfortunately most practical applications in this field are under NDA. (Defense
contracts, financial industry, any highly-algo-dependent businesses).

I'll poll my sources to find good examples that are free to share.

#### Uh, Coad Plz?
I did avoid the code at this point. I was hoping to be able to get into it but
every time I did it caused the talk to balloon from 30 minutes to an hour and a
half. The code behind making this happen is not trivial by any means. I'm hoping
to make more improvements there over time.

#### Y U NO TAEK QUESTIONS?!
That's my fault. I could cut an additional 5 minutes from the talk
by removing the stuff about how societies learn and quite a bit of the risk
management pieces. I feel like those are both really important points, but maybe
not for this specific presentation.


Thank you all for the feedback!
