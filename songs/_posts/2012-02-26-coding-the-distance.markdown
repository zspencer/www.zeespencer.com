<pre>
Reluctantly crouched at the command line
keyboards clicking and clacking in time
the green bar flashes, the vim pops up
churning, and burning, they push changes up
they deftly maneuver and regex to rename
fingers flying fast keyboards in flame
reckless and wild, they commit and they push
their prowess is potent though they sit on their tush.
as they speed through the release, the deploy goes out
they all get up and pour themselves stout
The team room is empty except for one man
still coding, and typing, as fast as he can
the sun has gone down and the moon come up
and long ago he's emptied his coffee cup
But he's coding, and typing, and stubbing things out
And hacking up a feature customers are raving about

He's deploying continuous
He's deploying with speed
She's all alone
In her time of need

Because he's hacking and cracking and moving to the next
He's fighting and typing and running his specs
He's deploying continuous

No bonus, no vacay, no pressrelease, no wine
He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force.
In his mind, he's still coding, still making the grade
She's hoping in time that her memories will fade.

Because he's hacking and cracking and moving to the next
He's fighting and typing and running his specs
the sun has gone down and the moon come up
and long ago he's emptied his coffee cup
But he's coding, and typing, and stubbing things out
And hacking up a feature customers are raving about

He's deploying continuous
He's deploying with speed
She's all alone
In her time of need

Because he's hacking and cracking and moving to the next
He's fighting and typing and running his specs
he's hacking and cracking and moving to the next
He's fighting and typing and running his specs

He's deploying continuous
He's deploying for speed
He's deploying continuous
