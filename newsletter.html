  <p>Since you seem like such a hoopy frood, perhaps
  you'd like to sign up for my semi-regular newsletter?</p>

  <p><em>Musings and Mumblings</em> is a weekly-ish set
  of interesting links with a short essay.  The essay
  may be about programming, design, technical
  leadership, or anything that strikes my fancy.</p>
