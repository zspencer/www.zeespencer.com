<p>Dear Backbone,</p>

<p>It&#39;s been fun. We&#39;ve had some incredible times together. But I just
don&#39;t see us working out.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, you have some nice features, your code base is relatively
clean, you have good test coverage, and features don&#39;t change drastically
between releases.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>But you don&#39;t seem to understand what I want. I mean, yea, I <em>crave</em> a clear
separation of concerns between domain, persistance, and presentation layers. I
<em>demand</em> a way to keep my html free from javascript (and vice versa). I may even
sometimes want a way to play nicely with the browser history as people interact
broadly with my app.</p>

<p>But dammit, I don&#39;t need something that binds events for me. I don&#39;t need
something to determine which code to execute based upon which url I happen to be
on. I&#39;ll be damned if I start treating javascript like a &quot;class inheritance&quot;
system when it&#39;s prototypical. I sure as hell don&#39;t want to throw away what
little knowledge I have of javascript to follow one of many competing half baked
idioms for javascript application structure.</p>

<p>Maybe I don&#39;t get it. Maybe it&#39;s me, not you. But let&#39;s face it: You don&#39;t help
me be more productive. That&#39;s why I use rails in spite of it&#39;s crazy desire to
modify base objects, poor architecture, silly ActiveRecord, and absurd routing
system. I can go from 0 to app in about 5 minutes with Rails. With you, it is
30~45. Part of it is lack of practice, but part of it is how little you actually
do for me. Sure, your persistence layer is fantastic.  But your views? Now
you&#39;re just getting in the way of javascript&#39;s event binding! Don&#39;t even get me
started on routing. If a query variable is part of the URL it breaks? Really?!</p>

<p>I&#39;m burnt out on javascript app frameworks. I think I&#39;ll stick with jQuery.</p>

<p>I know it isn&#39;t sexy. I know 99% of jQuery plugins are giant pile of poo. I
know jQuery doesn&#39;t provide me with a reasonable way to separate my concerns.
That&#39;s why I lean on libraries like
<a href="http://westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/">lawnchair</a>,
<a href="http://pjax.heroku.com/">pjax</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a>, and
<a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">underscore</a>.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t make javascript into something else, work well in greenfield or
legacy applications, and can be used independently without significantly
altering your codebase or workflow.</p>

<p>Without a framework it&#39;s up to me to ensure I don&#39;t create a big ball of mud.
It&#39;s up to me to make sure I seperate my concerns. It&#39;s up to me to create clean
code.</p>

<p>To be honest, that&#39;s how I like it.</p>
