#### How do we get feedback when remote or a jr developer?
* Contribute to OSS outside of work, get feedback that way
* Spend more of your time outside of work improving your skills
* Write and blog! It's a great outlet for introverts
* Find a small group of people a small set of people and learning from them
* As you get more senior, individual environments may have less to teach you
* When feedback is limited, listen to any and all of it
* Read the [Mastery Book by George Leonard](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment/dp/0452267560)
* Meditate on your weaknesses and intentionally confront them

#### How do we give good feedback as a mentor?
* Meet the people you're mentoring at the same level they're at. It's easy to be intimidating!
* If you're building an ongoing relationship prepare what you're going to say ahead of time
* If you're online/at a conference think before you talk and empathize. Put yourself in the position of "If I didn't know this what would be the easiest way to explain it?"
* Don't throw a bunch of words out at once. Pause a second, explain what jargon means. Assume they don't know what something means without treating them like an idiot
* Make clear there's no such thing as a stupid question as early as possible
* Approach the material as if you didn't know it. Try to reach your beginners mind
* Ask if they don't know what something means, make sure they know it's ok not to
* Asking as a question can help save time on explaining stuff they already know
* Try to learn something new yourself so you know what it's like to not know something
* Read [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382)
* Be the designated stupid question guy. This helps people who don't know be more comfortable asking the next question
* Role play! Ask someone to teach you something you already know and try to be confused
* Many of the words we use interchangeably (method, procedure, function) can be really confusing

#### What do you look for to give feedback on?
* Look for things outside the norm. start somewhere, pull threads, and see where we end up
* Code reviews: Use github and leave inline remarks. Be careful to make sure your tone doesn't get too personal
* Ask people to justify what they are doing. Not in a "WTF?! way" but in a "did you consider this? What were the pros/cons?"
* The best teacher is experience! Share your experience!

#### How do we build the good coder meta skills? (Problem exploration, comparing libraries, etc)
* Do them, set an example. Exposure to good coders is the best case scenario
* Make lots of tiny course corrections to create a improvement in skills. Skills often don't increase in leaps and bounds
* Little comments here and there can be helpful
* Use artifacts (code, designs, etc) as the basis for conversations as they have a lot of information in them!
* We can't just point someone at a dictionary definition. We give a million examples and that creates the intuition for what it means
* Let people flounder! We learn from falling
* It can be tricky when working on production. We don't want to let mistakes in. There has to be balance
* Try to draw the better idea out of the learner

#### How do we scale mentoring and apprenticeship?
* Learners should try to phrase questions so that they get the most value from the least amount of a mentors time
* You may never be an "official" apprentice. Just calling yourself one in your head may be enough
* Find a specific problem and set a regular pattern for working on it with someone, even if it's just getting feedback
* You may get a lot out of a peer relationship. Find someone on the same learning trajectory
* Teaching is a great way to really learn something
* Apprenticeship could scale if everyone finds someone who is a little bit ahead to learn from and a little bit behind to teach
* You don't have to be "senior enough." Most training for beginners in martial arts comes from the yellow belt instead of the black belt
