      <h2>Defining My Dream Job</h2>

    <section id="article">
<p>About a year ago I got back into freelancing and started building a small,
distributed development studio. While I enjoyed the freedom and the people; I
couldn&#39;t sustain the constant sales cycle and discovered management and
operations is a recipe for burnout for me. My constant anxiety over payroll,
bookkeeping and cash flow was debilitating.</p>

<p>I could write in depth about what I&#39;ve learned about myself and running a
business over the past year; or describe the agony of laying off good people who
may struggle to find new work due to systemic bias; or tipping into depression
due to a combination of burnout and the erosion of my self-confidence. But
instead I&#39;d like to look forward. It&#39;s less painful.</p>

<p>It is time to shut down the consultancy side of Zinc. Zinc will remain focused
on <a href="https://apprenticeship.community">The Apprenticeship Community</a> and <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/justenoughmedia">Just
Enough Media</a>. We&#39;ve ramped down our
delivery team, and while most have found new homes already; if you&#39;re a
pairing company looking for junior and/or senior Javascript / Ruby developers
<a href="mailto:zee@wecohere.com">ping me</a>.</p>

<p>This also means I am officially looking for full or part-time work; and do not
intend to continue consulting (at least, not primarily as a deliverer of
software).</p>

<p>What would hiring me do for your team? My entire career has been built by
combining a reasonable level of proficiency at shipping working software with
the ability to to create opportunity for those around me to improve their
skills.</p>

<p>My undying passion is helping teams and people become more effective. While I love
working closely with a team of compassionate, curious, cross-skilled peers
building solid software that meets customers needs and has a high degree of
technical quality; my greatest love is helping people plan, execute, and
reflect on their professional growth.</p>

<p>My ideal job consists of working with varied teams that recognize the
value of people of different backgrounds, skill levels, and perspectives. The
antithesis of the ego driven, senior obsessed, &quot;We hire the best&quot;
<a href="http://carlos.bueno.org/2014/06/mirrortocracy.html">mirrortocracy</a>.</p>

<p>I want to focus on guiding and facilitating peer mentorship and intentional
professional growth. I disagree completely with the notion that professional
growth &quot;happens naturally.&quot; It takes intentional investment in time and money.
It requires recognition that social and personal structures are a critical part
of a learning culture.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say I won&#39;t be coding. Collaborating on projects is required to
understand someone and assist them in planning their growth. I want
contributions to be evaluated not by features shipped or tasks completed but by
my fellow-workers ability to plan, observe and measure their professional
growth.</p>

<p>If I were to write my own job description, it would look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organizes and facilitates retrospectives, open-spaces, and other
peer-learning activities.</li>
<li><a href="http://mobprogramming.org">Mob programs</a> with teams and pair programs with
individuals with an emphasis on gleaning understanding and reflection while
doing work.</li>
<li>Facilitates one-on-one and/or small group learning planning and reflection.</li>
<li>Ships software as part of a set of teams, with an emphasis on
cross-pollination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, I&#39;d be happy to work with a company that can demonstrate that
these responsibilities are taken care of already.</p>

<p>I can subsist as an independent freelancer indefinitely; and will continue to
do so until I find the right place. How would I describe this place?</p>

<ol>
<li>It recognizes the insidious, destructive nature of micro-aggressions and
subtle *isms and considers compassion a core skill.</li>
<li>It has inoculated itself against &quot;senior-coder-itis&quot; and actively hires
across skill levels and specializations; while paying equitable salaries.</li>
<li>It prioritizes perks such as 401(k)s, trans-inclusive health care, and
sustainable pace over ping pong tables and free beer.</li>
<li>It is based somewhere with good mass transit; or allows remote work. I&#39;m
currently based out of Oakland, California and am highly interested in
Montreal, Quebec.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are interested, I&#39;d love to <a href="mailto:zee@wecohere.com">get in touch</a>.
If you&#39;re not, I&#39;d appreciate <a href="https://twitter.com/zspencer/status/628566493748289536">a signal boost on social
media</a>.</p>
