    <p>Over the years, I&#39;ve heard many ways to frame the tradeoff in work conditions
that optimize contributors&#39; work productivity and managers&#39; work productivity.
The most popular being &quot;Maker schedule, manager schedule.&quot; While I agree that
some kinds of work are best suited to specific work conditions, I&#39;m unconvinced
a manager versus individual contributor framing is helpful when attempting to
determine how to structure my workday.</p>

    <p>Having been with <a href="https://twitter.com/kmanion">Kiera</a> for going on 4 years now; and having lived together for 3 of those years; It seemed a bit unnecessary that we maintain separate budgets for shared resources like groceries, rent, utilities, streaming media accounts, etc. We&rsquo;d cobbled together a &ldquo;I&lsquo;ll pay for Blue Apron if you pay for the CSA&rdquo; form of spreading of fiscal responsibilities, but that was getting more and more complicated and difficult to balance to ensure an equitable split based upon our respective incomes.</p>

    <p>About a year ago I got back into freelancing and started building a small,
distributed development studio. While I enjoyed the freedom and the people; I
couldn&#39;t sustain the constant sales cycle and discovered management and
operations is a recipe for burnout for me. My constant anxiety over payroll,
bookkeeping and cash flow was debilitating.</p>

<p>I could write in depth about what I&#39;ve learned about myself and running a
business over the past year; or describe the agony of laying off good people who
may struggle to find new work due to systemic bias; or tipping into depression
due to a combination of burnout and the erosion of my self-confidence. But
instead I&#39;d like to look forward. It&#39;s less painful.</p>

    <p>Code review gets a bad rap. People worry that code reviews slow teams down,
create conflict between team members, or disempower team members by taking away
decision making authority.</p>

<p>I believe these concerns are anti-patterns that indicate a team is using code
review for <em>criticism</em> as opposed to <em>critique</em>. What&#39;s the difference?
<em>Critique is focused on specific parameters, where criticism is unbound.</em></p>

<p>That said, many programmers are unclear how to perform judgement free code
reviews. The following are a series of suggestions which may help move code
reviews from criticism to critique:</p>

    <p>Well-facilitated, compassionate
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649">retrospectives</a>
(the practice of taking time to discuss how to improve the effectiveness of a
team) are, in my experience, the core differentiator between a gelling,
high-performing team and a team that struggles to get things done.</p>

<p>Now that I work primarily on distributed teams, I&#39;ve found that retrospectives
are a touch harder. They lack the high-bandwidth feedback of body language that
can tell you early on when someone is getting upset or has something to say but
isn&#39;t quite ready to say it.</p>

    <p>Tests are use cases.</p>

<p>They illustrate <strong>how to use</strong> the code they&#39;re testing.</p>

<p>They provide <strong>examples</strong> of how the code works in a given context.</p>

<p>They <strong>describe</strong> the code&#39;s behavior.</p>

<p>They <strong>highlight pain</strong> in how to use the code.</p>

<p>They <strong>expose complexity</strong> in our code and the business domain.</p>

<p>When they <strong>notify us</strong> the code no longer behaves as specified? That&#39;s a bonus.
Not the goal.</p>

<p>When we test, we get <strong>critical design feedback</strong>.</p>

    <p>As bootcamp-esque educational programs train more people on the baseline skills
to contribute to a software project, companies are learning how (and how not) to
integrate these lower-cost, less experienced developers with their teams.
Frequently, these companies hire these less-experienced, single-skilled
individuals as &quot;Junior Developers&quot; and throw them at a project.</p>

<p>While this has some level of success, savvy companies are turning to

    <p>For the past year or so, I&#39;ve been doing most of my computing at a walking
desk. When I tell people this, they immediately ask &quot;But how?!&quot; or confidently
declare &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be able to walk while working!&quot;</p>

<p>While I was a bit skeptical at first, I find a walking desk fits quite nicely
into my work habits. I start the day with a mile or so walk, followed by
sitting and/or standing until lunch. After lunch I sit for a while, then switch
to walking. On a good day, I walk about eight miles. On average, I tend to walk
two to four miles a day.</p>

I will make. I make it. I review how it went. I learn when things don&#39;t go
well, and I learn when things do.</p>

<li>Move parenthesis around S-Expressions (aka &#39;slurping&#39; and &#39;barfing&#39;)</li>
<li>Access a Clojure REPL</li>
<li>Surround lines, words, etc. with parenthesis, braces, brackets and quotes</li>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t really know emacs and would rather focus on learning a
language than an editor; so I set out to find vim equivalents.</p>

    <p>As programmers, we split our code along what job those bits of code do for us.
We pontificate about whether MVVM or MVC or another pattern is the appropriate
way to build an app for the given language, environment, or problem domain.</p>

<p>This is valuable! Adaptable code knows little about other parts of the system,
and good application design patterns guide us to writing adaptable code with
little effort.</p>

<p>I am curious: how does slicing code along the job code does for users impact how
we build software?</p>

    <p>A long time ago, in an industry far far away, there were two competing
production models: the assembly line and the master craftsmen.</p>

<p>The master craftsmen hand built each and every machine. Painstakingly ensuring
it was beautiful and functional. Each machine was resplendent and tuned to
perfection, but it took days to build one.</p>

    <p>Professions are complex. From outside it looks solid.</p>

<p>Entrepreneur. Lawyer. Designer. Accountant. Developer.</p>

<p>Once we dig in we discover its diversity. Subtle differences become stark
contrasts.</p>

<p>We discover, explore, and absorb skills and ideas one after another.</p>

<p>The parts coalesce. Patterns direct our actions. We recompose our thoughts and
behaviors.</p>

    <p>I extracted my jekyll plugin for cache-busting from my blog into a gem,
<a href="http://github.com/zspencer/jekyll-cdn">jekyll-cdn</a>! The main feature is a set
of Liquid filters for getting the right <code>asset_path</code>, <code>stylesheet_path</code>, and
<code>javascript_path</code> for the environment you&#39;re building.</p>

<p>It&#39;s super light weight, provider agnostic, and doesn&#39;t require an asset
pipeline. Have fun fellow jekyll-lovers!</p>

<p>When I choose to be kind, I am forgotten.</p>

<p>When I choose to condemn, I am remembered.</p>

    <p>I have a small menagerie I take wherever I go. One who has accompanied me since
I was a child is Gertrude. Gertrude is a giraffe with a long, beautiful neck
with spots which spell four words: <em>Guess, Google, Grab, Go</em>.</p>

<p>When I get stuck Gertrude reaches up with her long neck and plucks a leaf out of
a Guessandtrythis tree. She drops it in front of me and prods me until I pick it
up. With each guess I gather information to help us make another, better guess.</p>

    <p>I recently experimented with hosting my blog on CloudFront. While this was
great for performance it caused a few issues.</p>

<p>Cloudflare does not translate <code>/foo</code> to <code>/foo/index.html</code>, which makes perfect
sense for performance; but causes problems if you depend on the server to
follow that lookup pattern.</p>

<p>To fix this I use S3 for <code>zeespencer.com</code> and CloudFront for
<code>assets.zeespencer.com</code> and the
<a href="http://github.com/zspencer/jekyll-cdn">jekyll-cdn</a> gem to provide Liquid
filters so switching between local testing and hosted is a snap.</p>

    <p>We seem to use <code>nil</code>s in place of a default return value in a function. Say you
wanted to write a function that splits a string on its commas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">nil_split_on_comma</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kp">nil</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">include?</span> <span class="s2">","</span>
  <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">","</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>While this seems reasonable it can have some unfortunate side effects:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">nil_split_on_comma</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"asdfqwer"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:length</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Woops! Undefined method map for <code>nil</code> class! Let&#39;s try again!</p>

<p>Since a much of the time building software is spent reading code, it&#39;s important
to decrease the amount of errors in understanding while we read.</p>

    <h3 id="the-ruby--symbol"><a href="/the-ruby-&-symbol">The Ruby & Symbol</a></h3>
    <p>&amp; is a powerful ruby operator, when you use it as a unary operator it has two
main use cases:</p>

<p>The most common is to pass an object as a block to a method, like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">reject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:nil?</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This calls <code>#to_proc</code> on the symbol <code>:nil?</code>, converts the result into a block,
and passes it to the reject method. A line by line breakdown looks something
like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">reject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:nil?</span><span class="p">)</span>

empowerment is an individuals choice. We choose how to respond to situations and
we can choose to remove ourselves from unacceptable situations.</p>

<p>The other stated empowerment requires us to have support from our community. It
needs structures in place so that negative situations are reduced and positive
situations are increased.</p>

    <p>No matter how well you define what should be done you will always wind up with
work that isn&#39;t quite right. In these situations you have three courses of
action:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reject the work and provide feedback.</li>
<li>Accept the work and add new work items.</li>
<li>Accept the work and ignore its imperfections.</li>
</ol>

    <p>Reluctantly crouched at the command line<br />
Keyboards clicking and clacking in time<br />
The green bar flashes, the vim pops up<br />
Churning, and burning, they push changes up<br />
They deftly maneuver and regex to rename<br />
Fingers flying fast keyboards in flame<br />
Reckless and wild, they commit and they push<br /></p>

    <p>Dear Backbone,</p>

<p>It&#39;s been fun. We&#39;ve had some incredible times together. But I just
don&#39;t see us working out.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, you have some nice features, your code base is relatively
clean, you have good test coverage, and features don&#39;t change drastically
between releases.</p>

    <p>I spent 5 hours practicing visual design.</p>

<p>I never picked up a pen.</p>

<p>I used a more familiar, less efficient tool.</p>

<p>It kept me focused.</p>

<p>Had I tried to a pen I would not have lasted 10 minutes.</p>

<p>I need to become more comfortable with pens.</p>

    <p>I am an external thinker.</p>

<p>When I write, I feel the words.</p>

<p>I touch them.</p>

<p>Once I see them, I know they are not the words I want</p>

<p>So I reshape them.</p>

<p>When I talk, whatever comes out is out.</p>

<p>No editing. No revising.</p>

<p>Never the words I want.</p>

    <p>Once I practiced daily, studied theory, explored composers and genres, and wrote
my own music.</p>

<p>I became a badass pianist.</p>

<p>Then I stopped practicing, experimenting, exploring, and creating.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m a shitty pianist.</p>

<p><strong>If we rarely practice, study, explore, or create we are not exceptional.</strong></p>

    <p>We coders have all kinds of definitions of simple code. To some, simple code is
code they understand and read easily. Others believe simple code follows the
coolest, most appropriate design pattern. Some say simple code has the fewest
characters.</p>

<p>Extreme Programming tries to settle that debate by offering
<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html">four qualities of simple code</a>:
testability, browsability, understandability, and explainability.</p>

    <p>The iron triangle has been redefined several times in the past few years.</p>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="http://www.noop.nl/2008/04/getting-square.html">Jurgen Appelo&#39;s Iron
Square</a>, <a href="http://jimhighsmith.com/beyond-scope-schedule-and-cost-the-agile-triangle/">Jim Highsmith&#39;s Agile

<a href="http://codesqueeze.com/the-broken-iron-triangle-is-broken/">Max Pool&#39;s Iron
Line</a>, and any
number of other variations. At first glance, these seem like good models which
allow us to balance needs.</p>
