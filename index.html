    <blockquote>
      <p>Zee is one of the more passionate developers I've worked with.
      His work is impeccable, as he takes the utmost care to craft it. Zee is
      great to work with--he is patient and explains things well. I thoroughly
      enjoyed pairing with him at Outpace, and felt he brought a needed quality
      of excellence to our team.</p>
