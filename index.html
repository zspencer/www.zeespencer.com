    <p>Building high quality software in a small team requires thoughtful application
of both soft <em>and</em> sharp focus. As primarily a back end or systems engineer, I
rely heavily on UI tooling to offload cognitive overhead without sacrificing
design quality.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I&#39;ve heard many ways to frame the tradeoff in work conditions
that optimize contributors&#39; work productivity and managers&#39; work productivity.
The most popular being &quot;Maker schedule, manager schedule.&quot; While I agree that
some kinds of work are best suited to specific work conditions, I&#39;m unconvinced
a manager versus individual contributor framing is helpful when attempting to
determine how to structure my workday.</p>

    <p>Having been with <a href="https://twitter.com/kmanion">Kiera</a> for going on 4 years now; and having lived together for 3 of those years; It seemed a bit unnecessary that we maintain separate budgets for shared resources like groceries, rent, utilities, streaming media accounts, etc. We&rsquo;d cobbled together a &ldquo;I&lsquo;ll pay for Blue Apron if you pay for the CSA&rdquo; form of spreading of fiscal responsibilities, but that was getting more and more complicated and difficult to balance to ensure an equitable split based upon our respective incomes.</p>

    <p>About a year ago I got back into freelancing and started building a small,
distributed development studio. While I enjoyed the freedom and the people; I
couldn&#39;t sustain the constant sales cycle and discovered management and
operations is a recipe for burnout for me. My constant anxiety over payroll,
bookkeeping and cash flow was debilitating.</p>

<p>I could write in depth about what I&#39;ve learned about myself and running a
business over the past year; or describe the agony of laying off good people who
may struggle to find new work due to systemic bias; or tipping into depression
due to a combination of burnout and the erosion of my self-confidence. But
instead I&#39;d like to look forward. It&#39;s less painful.</p>

    <h3 id="effective-code-critique"><a href="/effective-code-critique">Effective Code Critique</a></h3>
    <p>Code review gets a bad rap. People worry that code reviews slow teams down,
create conflict between team members, or disempower team members by taking away
decision making authority.</p>

<p>I believe these concerns are anti-patterns that indicate a team is using code
review for <em>criticism</em> as opposed to <em>critique</em>. What&#39;s the difference?
<em>Critique is focused on specific parameters, where criticism is unbound.</em></p>

<p>That said, many programmers are unclear how to perform judgement free code
reviews. The following are a series of suggestions which may help move code
reviews from criticism to critique:</p>

    <p>Well-facilitated, compassionate
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649">retrospectives</a>
(the practice of taking time to discuss how to improve the effectiveness of a
team) are, in my experience, the core differentiator between a gelling,
high-performing team and a team that struggles to get things done.</p>

<p>Now that I work primarily on distributed teams, I&#39;ve found that retrospectives
are a touch harder. They lack the high-bandwidth feedback of body language that
can tell you early on when someone is getting upset or has something to say but
isn&#39;t quite ready to say it.</p>

    <p>Tests are use cases.</p>

<p>They illustrate <strong>how to use</strong> the code they&#39;re testing.</p>

<p>They provide <strong>examples</strong> of how the code works in a given context.</p>

<p>They <strong>describe</strong> the code&#39;s behavior.</p>

<p>They <strong>highlight pain</strong> in how to use the code.</p>

<p>They <strong>expose complexity</strong> in our code and the business domain.</p>

<p>When they <strong>notify us</strong> the code no longer behaves as specified? That&#39;s a bonus.
Not the goal.</p>

<p>When we test, we get <strong>critical design feedback</strong>.</p>

    <p>As bootcamp-esque educational programs train more people on the baseline skills
to contribute to a software project, companies are learning how (and how not) to
integrate these lower-cost, less experienced developers with their teams.
Frequently, these companies hire these less-experienced, single-skilled
individuals as &quot;Junior Developers&quot; and throw them at a project.</p>

    <p>For the past year or so, I&#39;ve been doing most of my computing at a walking
desk. When I tell people this, they immediately ask &quot;But how?!&quot; or confidently
declare &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be able to walk while working!&quot;</p>

<p>While I was a bit skeptical at first, I find a walking desk fits quite nicely
into my work habits. I start the day with a mile or so walk, followed by
sitting and/or standing until lunch. After lunch I sit for a while, then switch
to walking. On a good day, I walk about eight miles. On average, I tend to walk
two to four miles a day.</p>

<li>Move parenthesis around S-Expressions (aka &#39;slurping&#39; and &#39;barfing&#39;)</li>
<li>Access a Clojure REPL</li>
<li>Surround lines, words, etc. with parenthesis, braces, brackets and quotes</li>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t really know emacs and would rather focus on learning a
language than an editor; so I set out to find vim equivalents.</p>

    <p>As programmers, we split our code along what job those bits of code do for us.
We pontificate about whether MVVM or MVC or another pattern is the appropriate
way to build an app for the given language, environment, or problem domain.</p>

<p>This is valuable! Adaptable code knows little about other parts of the system,
and good application design patterns guide us to writing adaptable code with
little effort.</p>

<p>I am curious: how does slicing code along the job code does for users impact how
we build software?</p>

    <p>Professions are complex. From outside it looks solid.</p>

<p>Entrepreneur. Lawyer. Designer. Accountant. Developer.</p>

<p>Once we dig in we discover its diversity. Subtle differences become stark
contrasts.</p>

<p>We discover, explore, and absorb skills and ideas one after another.</p>

<p>The parts coalesce. Patterns direct our actions. We recompose our thoughts and
behaviors.</p>

    <p>I extracted my jekyll plugin for cache-busting from my blog into a gem,
<a href="http://github.com/zspencer/jekyll-cdn">jekyll-cdn</a>! The main feature is a set
of Liquid filters for getting the right <code>asset_path</code>, <code>stylesheet_path</code>, and
<code>javascript_path</code> for the environment you&#39;re building.</p>

<p>It&#39;s super light weight, provider agnostic, and doesn&#39;t require an asset
pipeline. Have fun fellow jekyll-lovers!</p>

    <p>It&#39;s easy when hurt to lash out.<br /> To crush those who caused me pain.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard when hurt to reach out.<br /> To comfort those who caused me pain.</p>

<p>When I choose to be kind, I am forgotten.</p>

<p>When I choose to condemn, I am remembered.</p>

<p>I broker my humanity for a moment of hate.</p>

<p>I trade my dignity for a flash of pride.</p>

    <p>I have a small menagerie I take wherever I go. One who has accompanied me since
I was a child is Gertrude. Gertrude is a giraffe with a long, beautiful neck
with spots which spell four words: <em>Guess, Google, Grab, Go</em>.</p>

<p>When I get stuck Gertrude reaches up with her long neck and plucks a leaf out of
a Guessandtrythis tree. She drops it in front of me and prods me until I pick it
up. With each guess I gather information to help us make another, better guess.</p>

    <p>I recently experimented with hosting my blog on CloudFront. While this was
great for performance it caused a few issues.</p>

<p>Cloudflare does not translate <code>/foo</code> to <code>/foo/index.html</code>, which makes perfect
sense for performance; but causes problems if you depend on the server to
follow that lookup pattern.</p>

<p>To fix this I use S3 for <code>zeespencer.com</code> and CloudFront for
<code>assets.zeespencer.com</code> and the
<a href="http://github.com/zspencer/jekyll-cdn">jekyll-cdn</a> gem to provide Liquid
filters so switching between local testing and hosted is a snap.</p>

    <p>We seem to use <code>nil</code>s in place of a default return value in a function. Say you
wanted to write a function that splits a string on its commas:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">nil_split_on_comma</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>While this seems reasonable it can have some unfortunate side effects:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">nil_split_on_comma</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"asdfqwer"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:length</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Woops! Undefined method map for <code>nil</code> class! Let&#39;s try again!</p>

<p>As you know, I&#39;m a computer programmer. Or a nerd. Or whatever. Essentially
people give me money to sit on my butt and get fatter. Yes Mom, I know I haven&#39;t

    <h3 id="the-ruby--symbol"><a href="/the-ruby-&-symbol">The Ruby & Symbol</a></h3>
    <p>&amp; is a powerful ruby operator, when you use it as a unary operator it has two
main use cases:</p>

<p>The most common is to pass an object as a block to a method, like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">reject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:nil?</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This calls <code>#to_proc</code> on the symbol <code>:nil?</code>, converts the result into a block,
and passes it to the reject method. A line by line breakdown looks something
like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">reject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:nil?</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">reject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">proc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:nil?</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_proc</span><span class="p">))</span>

empowerment is an individuals choice. We choose how to respond to situations and
we can choose to remove ourselves from unacceptable situations.</p>

<p>The other stated empowerment requires us to have support from our community. It
needs structures in place so that negative situations are reduced and positive
situations are increased.</p>

    <p>To ring in the new year, I want to expose some of my ignorance.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a pretty sharp developer, I&#39;m competent at experience and interaction design, and
I&#39;m reasonably good at running a business. Yet I&#39;m not even nearing an expert in
any of those things.</p>

<p>My strongest skills by far are in programming and my social circle attracts
fellow programmers. I love these people. They&#39;re smart, talented, have broad
sets of interests, and tongs of experience but they grow me more as a developer
or engineer than as a designer or a businessman.</p>

<p>Deepening my programming skills can make it difficult to relate with people
outside of that domain. I&#39;m glad I chose to focus on programming
for the past few years, but I want to shore up the skills I&#39;ve been
neglecting; which leads me to my question:</p>

<p>How do you find mentors outside of your core skill sets? How do you build
relationships with people who have passions orthogonal to yours?</p>

    <p>Let me start this off by saying I&#39;m furious. I&#39;m furious at my gender, and my
&#39;professional&#39; community.</p>

<p>Maybe you haven&#39;t seen Iris Classon&#39;s <a href="http://www.irisclasson.com/2012/12/19/stupid-question-107-shhh-harassment-not-a-problem-strong-content-warning/">recent blog post about her
stalker</a>,
but here&#39;s the gist: she&#39;s been programming for a year and a half and she is
already experiencing the worst of us. Our sexism. Our selfishness. Our
lack of decency.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to tolerate this kind of behavior. We can reject those that
propagate it. We can shout down those who defend it.</p>

<p>Why the hell are we debating if conferences should have anti-harassment
policies? Why are we surprised when a woman shows up at a user group? Why do we
assume that just because someone is different they can&#39;t be as good as us?</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what this is; an inability to interact with anything or anyone
different than us. This is us thinking we&#39;re the best thing to happen to the
universe. This is poison.</p>

<p>Grow up. We&#39;re not in high school anymore. We don&#39;t have to act like a frat
house. We can treat each other with dignity and respect.</p>

    <p>While at Devbootcamp last week I was introduced to a new phrase by an
instructor. I asked how intensely draining his job must be, and he remarked
that his wife is amazingly good at &quot;keeping space&quot; for him. I didn&#39;t grasp what
he meant, so I asked him to clarify.</p>

<p>&quot;Keeping space,&quot; he said, &quot;is when my wife gives me a safe haven to release the
pent up emotions from spending all day investing myself in the students here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it&#39;s like being an emotional anchor?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Not quite,&quot; he replied. &quot;While it is about providing a ground for all that
energy; It&#39;s also about providing a safe place for me to be broken;  a place
where even when I am at my worst she&#39;ll still accept me and care about me and
not hold it against me.&quot;</p>

<p>Who in your life keeps space for you? Who do you keep space for? How do you
practice it?</p>

test, <a href="https://gist.github.com/4141476#file_let_spec.rb">nested describes and
lets</a>, and using a <a href="https://gist.github.com/4141476#file_custom_assertion_spec.rb">custom
assertion</a>.</p>

<p>I was pointing out how moving the method call out to a custom assert hid a
breadcrumb developers would use when understanding the system under test, while
leaving it in a let would at least keep it in the same test file. Enrique
responded with an interesting perspective:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;That&#39;s the point of BDD. Your tests shouldn&#39;t care about your implementation
at all.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I was a little taken aback. One of my favorite parts about clearly written specs
is how they give the programmer direction in the use of the code being tested.
If the test code is completely ignorant of the implementation, how can it
provide those insights?!</p>

<p>After an hour or so, I started thinking about <a href="http://about.me/searls">Justin
Searls</a> recent presentation on <a href="http://oredev.org/2012/sessions/budgeting-reality-a-new-approach-to-mock-objects">realism in
tests</a>.
This got me thinking: <strong>What if the level of realism and the level of ignorance
of a test are two related variables?</strong> A test which provides a high level of
realism of the system under test may not mock out external services the system
uses because it does not know about them. Conversely, tests which provides a low
level of realism often very clearly point out how its collaborators must be
formed, as well as the usage of the code under test.</p>

<p>Hopefully these complementary insights will provide me with more purposeful,
better organized test suites in the future.</p>

    <h3 id="the-proud-ants"><a href="/the-proud-ants">The Proud Ants</a></h3>
    <p>Once upon a time there was an ant colony. It wasn&#39;t a very big colony, but it
had the best hunters, builders, and nurses for miles around. For many seasons,
the colony prospered.</p>

<p>The builders dug out barracks for the hunters, nurseries for the nurses, and
dormitories for themselves. They dug stores for the food, which were soon
overflowing with the hunters spoils. The nurses raised strong children who
swelled the ranks of the colony, making it stronger than ever.</p>

<p>One day, the weather turned cooler. The hunters couldn&#39;t find as much food as
before. Soon the food they brought back was not enough to feed the colony, so
the Queen opened up the food reserves. </p>

<p>As winter grew longer the ants became afraid they would run out of food before
spring. The leaders of the castes, believing their own caste to be most
important, began to dissent.</p>

<p>&quot;My Queen! We are the builders. We built this strong home! You must give us more
food or we will all starve, and then who will prevent the tunnels from
collapsing upon us and killing us all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t listen to them!&quot; snapped the leader of the hunters. &quot;We are the ones who
found and brought the food! We deserve more food, or who will find food
when spring comes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear!&quot; moaned the leader of the nurses. &quot;Our poor children! How will we
protect them and teach them to be strong? Our entire colony will die out if we
lose our children We must have a larger share of the food!&quot;</p>

<p>The Queen was silent. She could see a seed of hate being planted in the hearts
of the formerly close brothers. Seeking to be fair and show her respect for
their leadership, she decreed:</p>

<p>&quot;Every caste will be given food, according to the amount of ants in it. It is up
to you, the caste leaders, to choose who to feed to make it through the winter.&quot;</p>

<p>The leaders were angry. &quot;You are weak!&quot; declared the hunter. &quot;You are not strong
enough to lead us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are unstable!&quot; gasped the builder, &quot;You lack the foundations to support us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are foolish!&quot; said the nurse, &quot;You are not wise enough to rule us!&quot;</p>

<p>But the Queen refused to relent.</p>

<p>Secretly, the leaders began to plot. Each believed their caste was strong enough
to survive on it&#39;s own, and so they decided that come spring time, they would
found their own colonies.</p>

<p>After a harsh winter, they set their plans in motion. Each leader left the
colony; taking the best of their caste with them and leaving the young, infirm,
and elderly.</p>

<p>The Queen was sad to see her formerly great colony torn apart, but resolved to
make the best of it. She gathered all who remained together into the great hall.</p>

<p>&quot;My people,&quot; she began, &quot;we have faced a harsh winter. We have been betrayed by
those we entrusted, and we have difficult days ahead of us. From now on, in
order to build respect between our castes, we will live together in towns of
mixed skills. Builders with nurses, nurses with hunters, and hunters with
builders. All food gathered by a town shall be theirs and their leaders shall
decide how to split it when the winter comes again.&quot;</p>

<p>Murmurs ran through the crowd &quot;But those dirty hunters are who got us into this
mess in the first place!&quot; shouted an elderly builder. &quot;I don&#39;t want to share my
food with them!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you can find your own food on the surface and live on your own. But you
will no longer be given food from our hunters or care from our nurses.&quot; The old
builder was silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Fine.&quot; He grouched. &quot;I&#39;ll share my room. For now.&quot;</p>

<p>As the summer went on, the Queens colony grew stronger. Though much of the
wisdom of the experts had been lost, they were able to collect food, keep their
tunnels from collapsing, and rear their young. Slowly, the different castes grew
to respect each other, and enjoy living with one another.</p>

<p>As the summer slowly changed to fall three weak, strange ants came to the
colony to beg audience with the Queen.</p>

<p>&quot;Please,&quot; the first begged, &quot;I come from the colony of builders. We are in need
of aid. We built the most beautiful colony, with deep and strong tunnels, but we
were unable to find enough food to feed our children, and many of our strongest
builders are now unable to walk. Please, give us food so that we may survive!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; the second interjected, &quot;I am from the colony of hunters. We found much
food, and stored it for the winter; but the tunnels to our storehouses have
collapsed and we are starving. Give us the food instead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Queen!&quot; the third cried, &quot;I am from the colony of nurses. We have many
strong young children to feed, but we have been unable to store enough food for
winter because we cannot build storehouses to put them! We must have the extra
food so our children can live on!&quot;</p>

<p>The three began to quarrel amongst themselves again, pleading their cases and
shouting down their former brothers. The Queen was infuriated by their
pettiness, but moved by their plights.</p>

<p>&quot;Silence!&quot; she declared &quot;You nurses have many strong young ants, go to the
hunters and dig out their stores. Go to the builders and seek their wisdom to
guide you in reinforcing the hunters tunnels and building your own store rooms.
Hunters, give part of your food to the nurses for digging your tunnels and part
to the builders for their help in reinforcing them.&quot;</p>

<p>The three ants were shocked by this suggestion. &quot;Give up our food?!&quot; the hunter
replied. &quot;Never!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Help those selfish hunters?&quot; shouted the builder. &quot;I&#39;d rather die!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our children are strong,&quot; declared the nurse. &quot;We will make do without their help.&quot;</p>

<p>And so they left. After another harsh winter, the queen sent scouts to find the
colonies of her former friends. At the hunters colony, all was in ruins;
abandoned, but with inaccessible storehouses full of food. The builders colony
had become a beautiful tomb, filled with the dead. The nurses had survived, but
barely. All of the elders had been lost, and they were quibbling amongst
themselves.</p>

<p>The Queen, not being one to pass up an opportunity, dug out the store houses of
the hunters; offered sanctuary to the remaining nurses if they would live by her
rules; and formed a second colony in the builders majestic ruins.</p>

<p><strong>Respect those who are different, or starve in the winter.</strong></p>

    <h3 id="saul-kaplans-business-model-innovation-factory"><a href="/business-model-innovation-factory-book-review">Saul Kaplan's Business Model Innovation Factory</a></h3>
    <p>TL/DR: BMIF is a thought provoking look at what a business model is and how they
impact society. While it&#39;s content is exceptional, It has stylistic issues that
sometimes detract.</p>

<p>I met Saul late last year at BIF and I consider him a friend. As a friend, I
tend to hold him to an absurdly high standard. The book is good. I&#39;m just an
asshole.</p>

<ol>
<li>BMIF has a highly energized, well articulated, and compelling opening. It
starts by challenging what a business model is; introducing the idea <em>business
models are not simply how your business captures value; but also how one creates
value.</em> From there it challenges the notion business models are only for
business. Saul declares <em>business models are for everyone: nonprofits,
businesses, and even individuals.</em></li>
<li>This satisfying start struggles to live through the rest of the book. Saul&#39;s
amicable and compelling voice slips into reiterations of title phrases; each of
which could create a broader understanding of business model innovation if they
were subtle variations on the books core theme instead of repeats of the same
three or four words.</li>
<li>The content, while compelling, seemed heavily weighted on the negative.
Knowing Saul&#39;s penchant for inspirational storytelling; I expected more real
world examples of people rethinking how they create and capture value and
transforming businesses and society.</li>
</ol>

<p>When Saul releases a second edition here are the recommendations I would make:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete words. The book can be somewhat repetitious at times.</li>
<li>Share success. These ideas are transforming institutions all over the world.
Shout it from the mountaintops! Be proud!</li>
<li>Embrace variety. How many times is the word &quot;innovation&quot; used?</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d definitely do a read through of the eBook edition, but wait for the
hardcover before investing in a physical copy.</p>

    <h3 id="when-to-reject-and-accept-work"><a href="/rejecting-vs-breaking-out">When to Reject and Accept Work</a></h3>
    <p>No matter how well you define what should be done you will always wind
up with work that isn&#39;t quite right. In these situations you have three
courses of action:
1. Reject the work and provide feedback.
2. Accept the work and add new work items.
3. Accept the work and ignore its imperfections.</p>

<p>Choosing which course to take is dependent on a few concerns:
1. Timing
2. Solution/Problem Fit
3. Cost
4. Team Impact</p>

<p>Accepting the work despite imperfections is prudent when time is of the essence.
Blocking forward progress may be the best option if what was done is
significantly out of alignment with what needed to be done. Adding additional
work items while allowing the current one to move forward is perfect when the
work provides some value, but could be improved upon. When you have a team which
loves to see things getting done rejecting work may do more to demoralize them.
When you have a team that strives to have high quality work, rejecting may
communicate that you share their goal to create something impressive, even if it
takes longer.</p>

<p>Next time you&#39;re in a position to accept work think about these concerns.
Communicate why you have chosen to accept or reject the work. Hopefully
you&#39;ll wind up with smoother projects because of it.</p>

    <p>Dear Backbone,</p>

<p>It&#39;s been fun. We&#39;ve had some incredible times together. But I just
don&#39;t see us working out.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, you have some nice features, your code base is relatively
clean, you have good test coverage, and features don&#39;t change drastically
between releases.</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t seem to understand what I want. I mean, yea, I <em>crave</em> a clear
separation of concerns between domain, persistance, and presentation layers. I
<em>demand</em> a way to keep my html free from javascript (and vice versa). I may even
sometimes want a way to play nicely with the browser history as people interact
broadly with my app.</p>

<p>But dammit, I don&#39;t need something that binds events for me. I don&#39;t need
something to determine which code to execute based upon which url I happen to be
on. I&#39;ll be damned if I start treating javascript like a &quot;class inheritance&quot;
system when it&#39;s prototypical. I sure as hell don&#39;t want to throw away what
little knowledge I have of javascript to follow one of many competing half baked
idioms for javascript application structure.</p>

<p>Maybe I don&#39;t get it. Maybe it&#39;s me, not you. But let&#39;s face it: You don&#39;t help
me be more productive. That&#39;s why I use rails in spite of it&#39;s crazy desire to
modify base objects, poor architecture, silly ActiveRecord, and absurd routing
system. I can go from 0 to app in about 5 minutes with Rails. With you, it is
30~45. Part of it is lack of practice, but part of it is how little you actually
do for me. Sure, your persistence layer is fantastic.  But your views? Now
you&#39;re just getting in the way of javascript&#39;s event binding! Don&#39;t even get me
started on routing. If a query variable is part of the URL it breaks? Really?!</p>

<p>I&#39;m burnt out on javascript app frameworks. I think I&#39;ll stick with jQuery.</p>

<p>I know it isn&#39;t sexy. I know 99% of jQuery plugins are giant pile of poo. I
know jQuery doesn&#39;t provide me with a reasonable way to separate my concerns.
That&#39;s why I lean on libraries like
<a href="http://westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/">lawnchair</a>,
<a href="http://pjax.heroku.com/">pjax</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a>, and
<a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">underscore</a>.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t make javascript into something else, work well in greenfield or
legacy applications, and can be used independently without significantly
altering your codebase or workflow.</p>

<p>Without a framework it&#39;s up to me to ensure I don&#39;t create a big ball of mud.
It&#39;s up to me to make sure I seperate my concerns. It&#39;s up to me to create clean
code.</p>

<p>To be honest, that&#39;s how I like it.</p>

    <p>Michael Bolton wrote an exceptional article listing <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.developsense.com%2Fblog%2F2011%2F09%2Fat-least-three-good-reasons-for-testers-to-learn-to-program%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHXDMFi5sz7HvSmAi40Munf2ClJcg">three reasons for software
testers to learn to write
code</a>.
Here&#39;s three reasons why a tester <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> learn to code.</p>

<p>On one hand, this is incredibly important. After all, learning as much as we can
about as many things as we can is a powerful career move.</p>

<p>Yet there are some decent reasons why a software tester shouldn&#39;t learn how to
program. Bear in mind, I&#39;m not saying we shouldn&#39;t learn to program. I&#39;m merely
stating there are repercussions to learning to code which can harm our
awesomeness as a tester if we&#39;re not careful.</p>

<h3 id="1-the-more-we-think-like-a-computer-the-less-we-think-like-a-person">1. The More We Think Like A Computer, The Less We Think Like a Person.</h3>

<p>Computers, eh? All those zero&#39;s and one&#39;s. <strong>All that reductionist logic.
Absolutely zero innovation.</strong> As we learn to program, we discover
to program well we have to think like a computer. As we think like a computer,
we begin to focus on the happy path: &quot;What is the one thing I need to
do to verify this bit works.&quot; This focus blinds us to the less-happy path.</p>

<p>The more we learn to isolate, the harder it is to notice emergent issues.
Reductionism is powerful. Experiment driven systems like the scientific method
have reshaped our planet&#39;s surface and sent us to space.</p>

<p>But reductionism sucks when it comes to emergent properties. Bad. The best
testers are the adept at seeing the whole. They notice that twiddling this
feature here will impact the outcome of that feature there. <strong>Coding is
reductionist in nature, which is why we developers often screw up integration.</strong></p>

<h3 id="2-coding-is-hard-developers-are-good-at-it">2. Coding is Hard. Developers Are Good At It.</h3>

<p>Do you know how to write maintainable, expressive, working code? No? Neither do
I. And neither do most coders. But they&#39;re probably better at it than we are,
for now. After a while we can be a code master, but until then we run the risk
of creating automated checks that are less reliable than the code they&#39;re
checking. This causes false positives and a high cost of ownership.</p>

<p>But hey! If we follow some basic principles, devote ourselves to learning, and
remain pragmatic we may wind up being one of the best coders on the team. Then
our vengeance will be complete on those developers who spurned our bug reports
and laughed at our test plans!  Oh yes... Vengeance...</p>

<h3 id="3-the-more-time-we-spend-coding-the-less-time-we-spend-testing">3. The More Time We Spend Coding, The Less Time We Spend Testing.</h3>

<p>Given the <a href="http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/08/testing-vs-checking/">definition of checking and
testing</a>, test
automation is often not testing, it&#39;s the verification of testing.  I&#39;m not
advocating avoiding automating checks. That way lies madness. And bad software.
And tears. I&#39;m suggesting <strong>testers are highly skilled contextual evaluatores
who evaluate and communicate risk and reward to decision makers more effectively
than any automated check.</strong> Excellent testers prioritize that over learning the
intricacies of a programming language.</p>

<p>Learning to code as a way to improve your ability to evaluate risk and check for
errors more effectively is reasonable. Learning to code to convert test plans to
automated tests may not be.</p>

    <p>We coders have all kinds of definitions of simple code. To some, simple code is
code they understand and read easily. Others believe simple code follows the
coolest, most appropriate design pattern. Some say simple code has the fewest
characters.</p>

<p>Extreme Programming tries to setttle that debate by offering <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html">four qualities of
simple code</a>: testability,
browsability, understandability, and explainabilty.</p>

<p>To make these qualities easier to remember I coin the mnemonic TUBE.</p>

<h3 id="testable">Testable</h3>

<p>Can automated tests be written for each piece of functionality and permutation
of behavior? Are there positive <em>and</em> negative use-cases?</p>

<h3 id="understandable">Understandable</h3>

<p>When you read a function, does it do what you expected given it&#39;s method
signature? How long does it take to figure out what the code does?</p>

<h3 id="browsable">Browsable</h3>

<p>Can the code be browsed in an IDE? How quickly does someone who didn&#39;t write the
code find what they&#39;re looking for?</p>

<h3 id="explainable">Explainable</h3>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure this is here twice because it&#39;s so important. Can a different
developer tell you what the code does? Does their explanation match yours?</p>

<p>If your code meets these criteria, congratulations! Your code fits in the TUBE,
and when the TUBE fits, make commits!</p>
