    <p>In 2018, I set out to establish habits that made me physically, economically, and mentally               healthier. It's been tough, but worth it. And it gets easier every day.</p> <p>Here's the metrics I've used to guide me, the goals I set to improve those metrics, and where I am now.</p>

    <p>Having been with <a href="https://twitter.com/kmanion">Kiera</a> for going on 4 years now; and having lived together for 3 of those years; It seemed a bit unnecessary that we maintain separate budgets for shared resources like groceries, rent, utilities, streaming media accounts, etc. We&rsquo;d cobbled together a &ldquo;I&lsquo;ll pay for Blue Apron if you pay for the CSA&rdquo; form of spreading of fiscal responsibilities, but that was getting more and more complicated and difficult to balance to ensure an equitable split based upon our respective incomes.</p>

    <p>About a year ago I got back into freelancing and started building a small,
distributed development studio. While I enjoyed the freedom and the people; I
couldn&#39;t sustain the constant sales cycle and discovered management and
operations is a recipe for burnout for me. My constant anxiety over payroll,
bookkeeping and cash flow was/is debilitating.</p>

create conflict between team members, or disempower team members by taking away
decision making authority.</p>

    <p>Tests are use cases. They illustrate how to use the code, how the code behaves, how it works in a given context, highlight pain, and expose complexity.</p>
<p>When they notify us the code does not behave as specified? That's a bonus. Not the goal.</p>
<p>When we don't write tests, we miss out on design feedback.</p>

    <p>As bootcamp-esque educational programs train more people on the baseline skills
to contribute to a software project, companies are learning how (and how not) to
integrate these lower-cost, less experienced developers with their teams.
Frequently, these companies hire these less-experienced, single-skilled
individuals as &quot;Junior Developers&quot; and throw them at a project. While this has
some level of success, savvy companies are turning to

    <p>Now I know that love is blind<br />
In the dark your smile shines.<br />
My heart is stolen and I feel fine!<br />
Why is organ harvesting a crime?<br /></p>

    <p>Two lumps of clay were bought by a potter and set on her windowsill to
soften in the sun. The first was terrified of being prodded, poked, and shaped.
&quot;I don&#39;t want any part of this!&quot; He said, &quot;I&#39;m a good piece of clay! I don&#39;t
want to be a pot!&quot; and he hardened himself in the noon day sun.</p>

    <p>Over the past couple years I&#39;ve done a bit of remote pairing. When I need a GUI
everything is pretty straightforward: <a href="http://join.me">Join.me</a> for
screen/keyboard sharing and iPad with Skype or Google Hangout for video calls.
This is pretty bandwidth intensive and can be slow, so I&#39;d rather keep as much
as I can in a terminal.</p>

he meant, so I asked him to clarify.</p>

up with work that isn&#39;t quite right. In these situations you have three
courses of action:
1. Reject the work and provide feedback.
2. Accept the work and add new work items.
3. Accept the work and ignore its imperfections.</p>

code they understand and read easily. Others believe simple code follows the
coolest, most appropriate design pattern. Some say simple code has the fewest
