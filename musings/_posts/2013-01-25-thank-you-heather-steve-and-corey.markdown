Recently I saw a few highly critical tweets go by my stream about a package
written by Heather Arthur. They were by Corey Haines and Steve Klabnik, a couple
of my friends.

Heather discovered the tweets and was [justifiably hurt by
them](http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/). Both
[Corey](http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/2013/01/im-sorry.html?m=1) and
[Steve](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2013-01-23-node) posted apologies;
which Heather
[accepted](https://twitter.com/harthvader/status/294609044323328000).

Everyone handled this better than I could. Heather called out behavior that
caused her pain. Steve and Corey acknowledged their hurtful behavior. Everyone
was respectful, open, and honest.

I've been impressed

Heather.

Thank you Heather for setting an example to others to share when they're
hurting. Thank you community, for supporting Heather's vulnerability. Thank you
Steve and Corey for taking responsibility for your actions.

Ya'll make me happy to be a programmer.
