title: A Few Thoughts on Feedback Models
tags: [drafts]
---
Feedback is important. It shapes our relationships, behaviors, and mindsets.
Different people have different preferences for receiving and giving feedback. Imagine that these preferences are opposed axis:

 * Direct vs Indirect
 * Immediate vs Delayed
 * Public vs Private

## Direct vs Indirect
Directness of feedback is not about timing, but about clarity. Direct feedback
is explicitly targeted towards the person or their behavior. It is not couched
with any kind of subtlety. Someone who is thick skinned or doesn't realize
feedback is being given often benefits from direct feedback. 

Indirect feedback can be directed towards a thing or event and smoothed with tact. This
helps if a person reacts strongly to direct feedback or is very observant.

## Immediate vs Delayed
I believe timing is even more important than directness when determining how to give someone feedback. If someone is not in the moment to hear the feedback, it does not matter how well you give it. Different time frames can even impact what kind of feedback people are willing and able to hear!

immediatte owhen behavior must be addressed immediately. delayed when person
needs time before capable of receiving feedback

timing is about receptiveness. feedback given to someone who is not receptive is
useless.

public vs private
private for most, public when behavior reqquires immediate addressing. sime
people are more receptive to public feedback than others. in fact some may
prefer. this is not common.
