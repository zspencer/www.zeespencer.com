As a voracious learner, I thrive on feedback. So much so that I often infer feedback even when none is given. What Ive noticed is that different people receive different kinds of feedback in different ways. 

feedback axis: 
 * direct vs indirect
 * immediate vs delayed
 * public vs private

direct vs indirect
use direct when: person is thick skinned or self validated. indirect whien
someone is sensitive or externally validated.

immediate vs delayed
immediatte owhen behavior must be addressed immediately. delayed when person
needs time before capable of receiving feedback

timing is about receptiveness. feedback given to someone who is not receptive is
useless.

public vs private
private for most, public when behavior reqquires immediate addressing. sime
people are more receptive to public feedback than others. in fact some may
prefer. this is not common.
