I just spent 5 hours practicing what little visual design skills I have.

I never picked up a pen.

I used a tool I was more familiar with. More comfortable with.

That kept me focused.

If I had tried to use a pen, I would have stopped within 10 minutes.

Maybe I need to get more comfortable with a pen.
