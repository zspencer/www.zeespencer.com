Let me start this off by saying I'm furious. I'm furious at my gender, and my
'professional' community.

Maybe you haven't seen Iris Classon's [recent blog post about her
stalker](http://www.irisclasson.com/2012/12/19/stupid-question-107-shhh-harassment-not-a-problem-strong-content-warning/),
but here's the gist: she's been programming for a year and a half and she is
already experiencing the worst of us. Our sexism. Our selfishness. Our
lack of decency.

We don't have to tolerate this kind of behavior. We can reject those that
propagate it. We can shout down those who defend it.

Why the hell are we debating if conferences should have anti-harassment
policies? Why are we surprised when a woman shows up at a user group? Why do we
assume that just because someone is different they can't be as good as us?

And that's what this is; an inability to interact with anything or anyone
different than us. This is us thinking we're the best thing to happen to the
universe. This is poison.

Grow up. We're not in high school anymore. We don't have to act like a frat
house. We can treat each other with dignity and respect.
