title: Choosing Kindness over Condemnation
tags: [love, poetry]
---

It's easy when hurt to lash out. To crush those who caused me pain.

It's hard when hurt to reach out. To comfort those who caused me pain.

When I choose to be kind, I am forgotten.

When I choose to condemn, I am remembered.

I broker my humanity for a moment of hate.

I trade my dignity for a flash of pride.

_This is written in the wake of death threats being made to a woman who stood
up for herself. It's written in the wake of a man losing his job for an off
color joke. It's written in the wake of the million ways I sell my goodness
to my ego._
