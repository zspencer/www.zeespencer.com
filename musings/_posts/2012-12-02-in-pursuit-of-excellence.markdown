Excellence is not only about the task at hand.

* It's about treating others well
* It's about accepting criticism
* It's about knowing yourself

Excellence takes commitment. I have to work to remember:

* To trust first, question later
* To listen with my heart as well as my ears
* To appreciate and explore the subtle complexities of others views
* To give my attention firmly to those who ask of it
* To respond respectully, honestly, and directly

What values and principles guide your search for excellence?
