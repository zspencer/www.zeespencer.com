Excellence is not about the task at hand.

* It's about treating others well
* It's about accepting criticism
* It's about knowing yourself

If I wish to be an excellent consultant I need to:

* Start with trust
* Explore the context and subtleties of the situation
* Apply all of my attention
* Respect the viewpoints and decisions of others
* Charge only for what I excel at
* Have honest, direct, respectful conversations

What values guide your search for excellence?
