    <p>Woah! Super stoked you liked my tweets enough to click on that link thing
    beneath my face. Hell, if I'd seen that face I wouldn't want to click anywhere
    near it!</p>

    <p>Since you seem like such a hoopy frood, perhaps you'd like to sign up for my
    semi-regular newsletter?</p>

    <p>It's a far less noisy way to keep up with my thoughts on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Well crafted software</li>
      <li>Technical leadership</li>
      <li>Social justice</li>
    </ul>
