    <p>Woah! Super stoked you liked my tweets enough to click on that link thing
    beneath my face. Hell, if I'd seen that face I wouldn't want to click anywhere
    near it!</p>

    <p>Since you seem like such a hoopy frood, perhaps you'd like to sign up for my
    semi-regular newsletter?</p>

    <p>The newsletter is a weekly-ish set of interesting links as well as a
    short essay. The essay may be about programming, design, technical
    leadership, or anything that strikes my fancy.</p>
