<p>One of the things that I've appreciated over the decade I've spent building
software is when others have sat down with me and just listened and offered
career advice. Sometimes it's great, other times it's meh, but overall it's been incredibly rewarding.</p>

<p>So I'm giving back a bit. If you're interested, I'll happily spend ~30
minutes listening to you, asking questions and offering (hopefully not
terrible) personalized advice to guide you in your career as a software
developer.</p>

<p>Currently, slots are available from 9:30AM PST to 10:30AM PST, Monday and Thursday.</p>
