      <h2>Building Communities of Empowerment</h2>

<p>Recently I sat in on a conversation between two people I respect. One declared
empowerment is an individuals choice. We choose how to respond to situations and
we can choose to remove ourselves from unacceptable situations.</p>

<p>The other stated empowerment requires us to have support from our community. It
needs structures in place so that negative situations are reduced and positive
situations are increased.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Both of them are right.</p>

<p>In the moment, I can choose to remove myself from an unpleasant situation. In
the future, I can choose to avoid groups that tend to put me into unpleasant
situations. But empowerment can&#39;t just be about retreating. It needs to make a
positive impact in the future. It needs to set the stage for richer, fuller
lives.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where empowerment requires strucure. It requires support. It requires
a community. It takes a lot of people to make the future a better place. It
takes a lot of light to drive out shadows.</p>

<p>Empowerment is not as simple as what you do for yourself or what is imposed upon
you. It&#39;s a complex, nuanced thing. If we want to attract good people
regardless of color, gender, or background we&#39;re going to need to understand
these nuances and balance between empowering ourselves and putting structures in
place to support each other.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this will be easy. It&#39;s hard to take the right amount of
responsibility for the situations we&#39;re in. It takes constant practice to
forgive and empathize when emotions run hot. It takes work to build communities
that back each other up. It&#39;s hard to shape a culture of empathy and support.</p>

<p>But damn, it&#39;s worth it.</p>
