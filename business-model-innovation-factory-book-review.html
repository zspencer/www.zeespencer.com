      <h2>Saul Kaplan's Business Model Innovation Factory</h2>

<p>TL/DR: BMIF is a thought provoking look at what a business model is and how they
impact society. While it&#39;s content is exceptional, It has stylistic issues that
sometimes detract.</p>

<p>I met Saul late last year at BIF and I consider him a friend. As a friend, I
tend to hold him to an absurdly high standard. The book is good. I&#39;m just an
asshole.</p>

<ol>
<li>BMIF has a highly energized, well articulated, and compelling opening. It
starts by challenging what a business model is; introducing the idea <em>business
models are not simply how your business captures value; but also how one creates
value.</em> From there it challenges the notion business models are only for
business. Saul declares <em>business models are for everyone: nonprofits,
businesses, and even individuals.</em></li>
<li>This satisfying start struggles to live through the rest of the book. Saul&#39;s
amicable and compelling voice slips into reiterations of title phrases; each of
which could create a broader understanding of business model innovation if they
were subtle variations on the books core theme instead of repeats of the same
three or four words.</li>
<li>The content, while compelling, seemed heavily weighted on the negative.
Knowing Saul&#39;s penchant for inspirational storytelling; I expected more real
world examples of people rethinking how they create and capture value and
transforming businesses and society.</li>
</ol>

<p>When Saul releases a second edition here are the recommendations I would make:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete words. The book can be somewhat repetitious at times.</li>
<li>Share success. These ideas are transforming institutions all over the world.
Shout it from the mountaintops! Be proud!</li>
<li>Embrace variety. How many times is the word &quot;innovation&quot; used?</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d definitely do a read through of the eBook edition, but wait for the
hardcover before investing in a physical copy.</p>
