title: Design is Choosing
tags: [article, draft]

We rave about design in magazines dedicated to aesthetic
beauty. We crow about design as the cornerstone of our strategy. We titter as
Apple unveils their latest innovation. And we forget.

We forget design is choosing.

We forget design is putting things in order.

We forget design is doing what is hard but right when it matters and doing what is easy
but wrong when it doesn\'t.

We forget design is doing what you excel at and delegating what you don\'t.

We forget design is facilitating between competing interests.

We forget design is deciding which constraints to embrace, and which to reject.

We forget design is saying no when you desparately want to say yes.

So remember.

Remember design is saying no so you can say yes to something else.

Remember design is being wrong, and loving every minute of it.

Remember design is spending time subtracting instead of adding.

Remember design is bringing ideas to life.

Remember design is pursuing what is important at the expense of everything else.

Remember design is clambering up the shoulders of giants.

Remember design is saying yes when you desparately need to say yes.
