title: Building Networks of Empowerment
tags: [draft, empowerment]

Recently I sat in on a conversation between two people I respect.  One declared
empowerment is an individuals choice. We choose how to respond to situations and
we can choose to remove ourselves from unacceptable situations.

The other stated empowerment requires us to have support from our community.  It
needs structures in place so when we take a stand we're not ostracized.

Both of them are right.

In the moment, I can choose to remove myself from an unpleasant situation. In
the future, I can choose to avoid groups that tend to put me into unpleasant
situations. But empowerment can't just be about retreating. It needs to make a
positive impact in the future. It needs to set the stage for richer, fuller
lives.

That's where empowerment requires strucure. It requires support. It requires
a community. It takes a lot of people to make the future a better place. It
takes a lot of light to drive out shadows.

Empowerment is not as simple as what you do for yourself or what is imposed upon you.
It's a complex, nuanced thing. If we want to attract good people regardless of
color, gender, or background we're going to need to learn how to empower
ourselves and put structures in place to support each other.

I'm not saying this will be easy. It's hard to take the right amount of
responsibility for the situations we're in. It takes constant practice to
forgive and empathize when emotions run hot. It takes work to build communities
that back each other up. It's hard to shape a culture of acceptance and support.

But damn, it's worth it.
