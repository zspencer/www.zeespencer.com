title: Building Networks of Empowerment

Recently I sat in on a conversation between two people I hold in high esteem.
One declared empowerment is an individuals choice. We choose how to respond to
situations and we can choose to remove ourselves from unacceptable situations.

The other stated empowerment requires us to have support from our community.  It
needs structures in place so when we take a stand we're not ostracized.

Both of them are right.

In the moment, I can choose to remove myself from an unpleasant situation.
In the future, I can choose to avoid groups that tend to put me into unpleasant
situations. But empowerment isn't just retreat. It's about making a
difference in the future. It's about setting the stage so you have a richer,
fuller life.

That's where empowerment requires strucure. It requires support. It requires
a community. It takes a lot of people to make the future a better place. It
takes a lot of light to drive out shadows.

Empowerment is not as simple as what you do for yourself or what is imposed upon you.
It's a complex, nuanced thing. If we want to attract good people regardless of
color, gender, or background we're going to need to learn how to empower
ourselves and put the right structures in place to support each other.

I'm not saying this will be easy. It's hard to take responsibility for our
lives.  It's hard to know when to stand up and fight. It takes constant practice
to forgive and empathize when emotions run hot. It's hard to find people that
will back you up. It's hard to craft a culture of acceptance and support.

But it's worth it.
