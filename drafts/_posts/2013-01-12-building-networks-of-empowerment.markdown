What is empowerment? For now, I'll define it as "taking steps towards the
situations one wants to experience."

Empowerment is best grasped in the context of time and difficulty. While I may
not be able to avoid an unpleasant confrontation once it's already started, I can
remove myself from it. It may be difficult to make large positive financial
strides if I'm burdened with a large amount of debt and a struggling economy,
but I can start to set the stage for financial security.

Empowerment is not simply what you do for yourself or what is imposed upon you.
It's a highly complex, nuanced thing. We need to understand these
nuances, demonstrate an empowered life, and provide just enough structure to
help others become more empowered.

I'm not saying this is easy. It's hard to take responsibility for our lives.
It's hard to know when to stand up and fight and when to open up and embrace.
It takes constant practice to forgive and empathize when emotions run hot.
