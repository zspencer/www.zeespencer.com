## System Models
* Should facilitate decision making
* Should be living
* Should be visible
* Should be interactive

## Persona Mapping
* You can't make something for everyone
* Knowing who the system intends to benefit makes decision making easier

## Story Mappingo
* Observing someone interacting with a system is better than listening to them
  talk about how they interact with the system
* Making the different levels of goals visible allows for more detailed
  understanding of the benefits of a system

### System Seams
* The seams between actions are ripe for innovation
* Observing the whole workflow around a task reveals the seams
