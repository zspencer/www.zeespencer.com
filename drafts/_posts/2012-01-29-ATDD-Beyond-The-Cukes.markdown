Most ATDD sessions are \"HERE ARE TEH CUCUMBERS! NOW GO MAKE AWESOME!\"

I want to take this past that level. Here are two things I\'d like to draw out explicitely.

1. The different styles of story tests and when they are each appropriate
    * Explicit interaction/Implicit Intention (When I fill in X And click Y)
    * Explicit intention/implicit Interaction (When I register, Then I am awaiting activition)
    * Permutation tables
2. How to write cross platform features and steps(Write one feature file, one step definition, execute across multiple platforms)
