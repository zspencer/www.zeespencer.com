title: The Hardest Part of Practicing Agile
tags: [article, draft]

You want to know the hardest part about working on an agile team?  No, it\'s not
swallowing the kool-aid; though it\'s difficult to choke down.  It\'s not test
driven development, though that has so many subtle layers of nuance I\'ll never
master it. It isn\'t refactoring, which requires you to see patterns in
complexity and gently untangle it with the deftness of an Akido master. It\'s
not being part of a whole team and doing whatever it takes to accomplish your
purpose with people you may have little in common with. It\'s not being able to
adapt your project\'s direction as deftly as a rock climber discovering just the
right place to stick their heel on a particularly perilous ascent.

Each of these are incredibly important and incredibly difficult.

So what\'s harder? Pairing. Pairing is hard. I mean really hard. Not just
because pairing can quite literally stink. Mints and honest, compassionate
feedback often take care of that.  Not because it\'s technically difficult.
After all, anyone can sit next to someone else for a few hours, point out typos
and feel good about \"contributing value.\"

Pairing is hard because it requires you to connect with someone for more than a
few minutes at a time. That person may not share your background, skills,
passion, or even vocabulary; yet in order for pairing to be worth it you must
communicate incredibly well. It requires you to be aware of and respond to
non-verbal cues, interact with your shared creation at the same time as your
pair, and sometimes even talk to each other.

When pair programming, I\'ve noticed some patterns that add to the challenge:

*  Motive Mismatches: These occur when each partner has a different goal, maybe
   one partner wishes to explore an idea they read about recently, while the
   other simply wants to finish the card and move on.
*  Competence Chasms: Sometimes you\'ll see two people with very different
   levels of skill pairing. One simply breathes code, the other is fresh out of
   college. Both struggle to interact due to the gap in their experiences.
*  Disposition Dissonance: People  have different communication styles. Maybe
   one is overconfident and the other is underconfident; one is introverted, the
   other extroverted.
*  Semantic Squabbles: These often occur when two strong personalities pair. One
   wants to use pattern x, the other wants to use framework y. Progress stops.
   Fistfight ensues.

Each of these have their challenges. Each of these have their benefits. None of
these are solved by avoiding these types of situations.
