title: When Good Pairing Goes Bad
tags: [article, draft]
---
Pairing is hard. I mean really hard. Not just because pairing can literally
stink. Mints and honest, compassionate feedback take care of that. Not because
it\'s technically difficult. Anyone can sit next to someone else for a few
hours, point out typos and feel good about \"contributing value.\"

Pairing forces you to connect with someone for more than a few minutes at a
time. That person may not share your background, skills, passion, or even
vocabulary; yet in order for pairing to be worth it you must communicate
incredibly well. It requires you to be aware of and respond to non-verbal cues,
interact with your shared creation at the same time as your pair, and sometimes
even talk to each other.

When pair programming, I\'ve noticed some patterns that add to the challenge:

*  Motive Mismatches: These occur when each partner has a different goal, maybe
   one partner wishes to explore an idea they read about recently, while the
   other simply wants to finish their current task and move on.
*  Competence Chasms: Sometimes you\'ll see two people with very different
   levels of skill pairing. One simply breathes code, the other is fresh out of
   college. Both struggle to interact due to the gap in their experiences.
*  Disposition Dissonance: People  have different communication styles. Maybe
   one is overconfident and the other is underconfident; one is introverted, the
   other extroverted.
*  Semantic Squabbles: These often occur when two strong personalities pair. One
   wants to use pattern x, the other wants to use framework y. Progress stops.
   Fistfight ensues.

Each of these have their challenges. Each of these have their benefits. None of
these are solved by avoiding them.

###Motive Mismatches
There are a few different things people look for when pairing: momentum,
knowledge transfer, deeper social connection, or just
to have some fun. Normally these motives are intertwingled, with a primary one
bubbling to the top.

However if two people have very different motives for the pairing session,
the session can go south fast.

#### Things to Watch For
A motive mismatch is often revealed by a lack of momentum. Frequent
starts and stops on your task, failures to come to agreement on what to do next,
or a building disinterest in continuing the pairing session are all indicators
that you may be experiencing a motive mismatch.

#### Where to Start
I generally recommend stopping what you are doing and having a short
conversation with your pair. Be direct but polite, explain that it looks like
you have different objectives for your pairing session. Clearly explain what you
want to get out of the pairing session, and ask what their top priority is. It
may be helpful to use questions in order to give them the vocabulary to explain
what they are looking for. You may discover that your desire to hone your skills
with with a new text editor is interfere with their desire to complete the task
at hand. You may even realize that you were focusing on the wrong
thing!

### Competence Chasms
We each have different things we\'re good at. Even two highly talented
programmers often have different specialities. This is often beneficial.
Diversity of thought leads to creative yet simple solutions where both
contribute the little different things that they know. Novices can often
spot problems by asking questions that jiggle their partners mental state just
enough that it provides them with the right decision.

However the chasm can also cause chaos. Trying to explain to a developer about
font selection strategies when they are unaware of the difference between
serif, sans-serif, and script fonts can be frustrating when you really just want
to solve an issue where people are making mistakes because they think two things
are more related than they actualy are.

#### What to Watch For
Competence chasms are by no means a bad thing, but they can be exhuasting. The
difference in perspective, knowledge, etc. can wear out a pair much faster than
if both people have similar skills and abilities.

It becomes easy to become disengaged from your partner, which results in
unproductive pairing.

#### Where to Start
First do a quick motive check, then consider taking a break. I find that
the Pomodoro technique is especially important when there is a large gap between
skills. It lets both people step away and look at the problem with fresh eyes
again.
