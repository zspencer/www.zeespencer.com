title: 4 Common Pairing Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
tags: [article, draft]

Pairing is hard; really hard. Not because pairing can literally stink or because
it is technically difficult. Instead it is because pairing requires you to
connect with someone for an extended amount of time. Your pair partner may not share
your background, skills, passion, or even vocabulary; yet when pairing you must
work together to accomplish a shared goal.

When pair programming, I've noticed some patterns which add to the challenge:

* Motive Mismatches
* Competence Chasms
* Disposition Dissonance
* Semantic Squabbles

###Motive Mismatches
There are many goals people have when pairing: momentum, focus, knowledge
transfer, social connection, or fun. Normally these motives are mixed, with a
few being most important in any given session. When goals are shared pairing is
fun and constructive. When they are different pairing can be unpleasant.

#### Things to Watch For
Motive mismatch are revealed by a lack of momentum. You may stop and start
abruptly, struggle to agree on what to do next, or become disengaged.

#### Where to Start
Stop and have a short conversation with your pair. Directly and politely point
out something seems wrong, explain your goals, ask for theirs, and create shared
goals. When goals are significantly different reassess them regularly so that
both partners get to meet their expectations.

### Competence Chasms
We all have things we're good at. This is good, as diversity of thought, skills
and experiences leads to creative yet simple solutions. Novices often spot
problems by asking questions that jiggle their partners mental state enough to
provide a new solution.

But the chasm can cause chaos. Trying to explain the concept of constraints and
how proximity implies relationship when your partner lacks a design background
can be frustrating when you want to solve the issue and move on.

#### What to Watch For
You may feel tired or frustrated, seem to only have arguments, or a partner who
is afraid to say anything.

#### Where to Start
When the goal is to share knowledge it may be ok that you are making little
progress on the task at hand. When you get tired take a break. This relieves the
exhaustion that can occur when pairing with someone at a different skill level.

When disagreeing you may want to defer to your pair and ask for further reading
or offer to discuss the idea over lunch. Regardless of experience your pair
offers insights which would be foolish to ignore just because they don't know
how to program, test, or design as well as you.

### Disposition Dissonance

We all have different personalities, passions, experiences, and quirks. These
differences can make pairing hard. Someone who doesn't talk much can feel
oppressed by a partner who laughs and jokes all day long. Someone who struggles
with self esteem could be devastated by a harsh word casually spoken.

#### Things to Watch For

Gauge their emotional state. If they are frustrated or disengaged or avoid
pairing with you in the future it can be because of personality differences.

#### Where to Start
Remember your pair partner is a person. Sometimes they seem odd, unsettling, or
disturbing; but they are rarely malicious or stupid. Once you accept your pair
is a good person doing the best they can it is easier to accept their quirks.

It may be useful to look into personality frameworks such as
[DISC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment). By understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of your and other personality types you can gain
insight into what you are doing that makes your pair upset.

### Semantic Squabbles
Different backgrounds result in different phrasing. What one calls a "resource"
another may demand be called a "person." There is no malice on either's behalf,
but it can result in hurt feelings and damaged relationships.

#### Things to Watch For
Words are powerful, and often create powerful emotions. Check your emotional
state if you hear a trigger word and  be aware of your pairs triggers. 

#### Where to Start
Your pair calling your project backlog and burnup a forecast it does not
necessarily mean they are treating it like a traditional project plan.

We all have words which trigger us. When you are triggered, breathe a few
breathes, ask a few questions, and try to understand their perspective. When
your pair is triggered, take a step back. Apologize, and replace your word with
theirs.
