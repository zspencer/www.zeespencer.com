title: 4 Indicators You're Pairing Badly and How To Fix Them
tags: [article, draft]
---
Pairing is hard; really hard. Not because pairing can literally stink or because
it is technically difficult. Instead it is because pairing requires you to
connect with someone for an extended amount of time. Your pair partner may not share
your background, skills, passion, or even vocabulary; yet when pairing you must
work closely together to accomplish a shared goal.

When pair programming, I've noticed some patterns which add to the challenge:

* Motive Mismatches
* Competence Chasms
* Disposition Dissonance
* Semantic Squabbles

Each of these have their challenges. Each of these have their benefits. None of
these are solved by avoiding them.

###Motive Mismatches
There are several goals people have when pairing: momentum, focus, knowledge
transfer, deeper social connection, or just to have some fun. Normally these
motives are intertwingled, with a primary one bubbling to the top. When these
goals are shared pairing is a fluid, constructive, collaborative experience.
When they go unsaid or are significantly different pairing can become quite
unpleasant quite quickly.

#### Things to Watch For
A motive mismatch is often revealed by a lack of momentum. You may
spend more time talking about an idea than creating something
together, stop and start with very little flow, struggle to come to agreement
on what to do next, or slowly lose interest in pairing. Each of these are smells
which may indicate a motive mismatch.

#### Where to Start
Stop what you are doing and have a short conversation with your pair. Be direct
but polite, point out something seems wrong, explain what your goals are,
and ask what theirs are. You may even realize you were focusing on the
wrong thing!

### Competence Chasms
We each have different things we\'re good at. Even two highly talented
programmers often have different specialities. This is often beneficial.
Diversity of thought leads to creative yet simple solutions where both
contribute the little different things that they know. Novices can often
spot problems by asking questions that jiggle their partners mental state just
enough that it provides them with the right decision.

However the chasm can also cause chaos. Trying to explain to a developer about
font selection strategies when they are unaware of the difference between
serif, sans-serif, and script fonts can be frustrating when you really just want
to solve an issue where people are making mistakes because they think two things
are more related than they actualy are.

#### What to Watch For
Competence chasms are by no means a bad thing, but they can be exhuasting. The
difference in perspective, knowledge, etc. can wear out a pair much faster than
if both people have similar skills and abilities.

It becomes easy to become disengaged from your partner, which results in
unproductive pairing.

#### Where to Start
First do a quick motive check, then consider taking a break. I find that
the Pomodoro technique is especially important when there is a large gap between
skills. It lets both people step away and look at the problem with fresh eyes
again.

### Disposition Dissonance

We are all different. We have different personalities, passions, experiences,
specialities and behavioral triggers. These differences are often why we succeed
as a team.

Yet these differences can make pairing hard. Someone who doesn't talk much can
feel oppressed by a partner who laughs and jokes all day long. Someone who
struggles with personal self worth could be devastated by a harsh word casually
spoken.

#### Things to Watch For
If you notice your pair responding (or not responding!) in a way that you expect
you're discovering they have a different perspective on life than you do. This
may not be a problem, but if they seem uncomfortable or frustrated, become
disengaged, or avoid pairing with you in the future, it can often be rooted in
personality differences.

#### Where to Start
Remember your pair partner is a person. Sometimes they seem odd, unsettling, or
disturbing; but they are rarely malicious or stupid. Once you accept your pair
is a good person doing the best they can given their experiences, knowledge, and
abilities it is easier to stop, reflect, and have a conversation.

It may be useful to look into personality profiling tools such as
[DISC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment). By understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of your and other personality types you can gain
insight into why your pair gets upset when you continue your thought before you
answer their question. Applying DISC rigidly can get in the way of actually
understanding your pair, but I find it a useful framework to start out with.

### Semantic Squabbles
Again, we all have different experiences. These different experiences are quite
often reflected in the phrasing that we use. What one calls a \"resource\" another
may call a \"person.\" Often there is no intended slight on either\'s behalf,
but one can is considered snooty and pedantic, and the other is considered a
heartless exploiter of human potential.

Obviously, neither are true. It is simply the result of different perspectives
and different practices. Two people, especially when pairing, can be so caught
up in these differences that they stop working towards a solution and instead
spend all their time trying to change their partners vocabulary. Often the only
effect is feelings being hurt, and relationships being damaged.

#### Things to Watch For
Be careful when you feel that swirl of emotion flurrying up into your chest.
\"Well, you just don\'t understand a RESTful application!\" you may think when
your partner inadvertently calls a SOAP service request a REST call.

Watch out for discussions about what something should be called. Sometimes these
discussions are important, reflecting hidden differences in underlying models of
understanding; but they can also simply be two people using just-so-slightly
different phrasing to mean the same thing.

#### Where to Start
First, acknowledge your buzz words. We all have buttons. Some of them are more
powerful than others. If you know you become triggered when someone
misinterprets usability to mean aestheticaly pleasing, then be
careful. Breathe a few breathes, ask a few questions, and genuinely attempt to
understand their perspective. Often times you\'ll discover that this deep,
painful point of contention is simply two people who have had different
experiences build their vocabulary.
