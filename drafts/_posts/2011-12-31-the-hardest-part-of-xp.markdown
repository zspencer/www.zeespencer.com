title: 4 Indicators You're Pairing Badly and How To Fix Them
tags: [article, draft]

Pairing is hard; really hard. Not because pairing can literally stink or because
it is technically difficult. Instead it is because pairing requires you to
connect with someone for an extended amount of time. Your pair partner may not share
your background, skills, passion, or even vocabulary; yet when pairing you must
work closely together to accomplish a shared goal.

When pair programming, I've noticed some patterns which add to the challenge:

* Motive Mismatches
* Competence Chasms
* Disposition Dissonance
* Semantic Squabbles

Each of these have their challenges. Each of these have their benefits. None of
these are solved by avoiding them.

###Motive Mismatches
There are several goals people have when pairing: momentum, focus, knowledge
transfer, deeper social connection, or just to have some fun. Normally these
motives are intertwingled, with a primary one bubbling to the top. When these
goals are shared pairing is a fluid, constructive, collaborative experience.
When they go unsaid or are significantly different pairing can become quite
unpleasant quite quickly.

#### Things to Watch For
A motive mismatch is often revealed by a lack of momentum. You may
spend more time talking about an idea than creating something
together, stop and start with very little flow, struggle to come to agreement
on what to do next, or slowly lose interest in pairing. Each of these are smells
which may indicate a motive mismatch.

#### Where to Start
Stop what you are doing and have a short conversation with your pair. Be direct
but polite, point out something seems wrong, explain what your goals are,
and ask what theirs are. You may even realize you were focusing on the
wrong thing!

### Competence Chasms
We all have things we're good at. Even two talented programmers often have
different specialities. This is good, as diversity of thought leads to creative
yet simple solutions. Novices can often spot problems by asking questions that
jiggle their partners mental state enough to provide a new solution.

But the chasm can cause chaos. Trying to explain the concept of constraints and
how proximity implies relationship when your partner does not have a design
background can be frustrating when you really just want to solve an issue and
move on.

#### What to Watch For
Be careful when pairing across proficiencies. Check to see if you're feeling
tired or frustrated. Depending on the personalities at play, you may even see
arguments between someone with more experience and someone with less.

#### Where to Start
Do a quick motive check. If the goal is to share knowledge then it may not be a
bad thing that you are making little progress on the task at hand. When you get
tired, take a break. Grab coffee or take a walk. This relieves some of the
mental exhaustion that can occur when pairing with someone more or less
experienced than yourself.

When disagreeing it is often prudent to defer to your pair and ask
for further reading or offer to discuss the idea over lunch. Regardless of
experience, your pair offers insights which would be foolish to
ignore just because they don't know how to program, test, or design as well as
you.

### Disposition Dissonance

We are all different. We have different personalities, passions, experiences,
specialities and behavioral triggers. These differences are often why we succeed
as a team.

Yet these differences can make pairing hard. Someone who doesn't talk much can
feel oppressed by a partner who laughs and jokes all day long. Someone who
struggles with personal self worth could be devastated by a harsh word casually
spoken.

#### Things to Watch For
If you notice your pair responding (or not responding!) in a way that you expect
you're discovering they have a different perspective on life than you do. This
may not be a problem, but if they seem uncomfortable or frustrated, become
disengaged, or avoid pairing with you in the future, it can often be rooted in
personality differences.

#### Where to Start
Remember your pair partner is a person. Sometimes they seem odd, unsettling, or
disturbing; but they are rarely malicious or stupid. Once you accept your pair
is a good person doing the best they can given their experiences, knowledge, and
abilities it is easier to stop, reflect, and have a conversation.

It may be useful to look into personality profiling tools such as
[DISC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment). By understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of your and other personality types you can gain
insight into why your pair gets upset when you continue your thought before you
answer their question. Applying DISC rigidly can get in the way of actually
understanding your pair, but I find it a useful framework to start out with.

### Semantic Squabbles
Often our different backgrounds result in different phrasing. What one calls a
"resource" another may demand be called a "person." There is no malice on
either's behalf, but it can result in hurt feelings and damaged relationships.

#### Things to Watch For
Words are powerful, and often create powerful emotions. Check your emotional
state if you hear a trigger word, or be aware if your pair is getting frustrated
with you.

Be aware not all discussions about what something should be called are
necessarily productive. Often they are important, reflecting hidden differences
in your problem domain; but sometimes they are two people using slightly
different words to mean the same thing.

#### Where to Start
Your pair calling your project backlog and burnup a forecast it does not
necessarily mean they are treating it like a traditional project plan.

We all have words which trigger us. When you are triggered, breathe a few
breathes, ask a few questions, and try to understand their perspective. When
your pair is triggered, take a step back. Apologize, and replace your word with
theirs. It may be worth having a discussion about it later, but for now you
should hold off.
