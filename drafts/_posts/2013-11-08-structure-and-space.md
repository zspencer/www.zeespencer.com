> First we shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us.

I first heard this phrase from my friend [Davin
Granroth](http://blog.davingranroth.com/). While it may have been meant
literally; I interpret it in a more allegorical fashion.

> _First we shape our society, thereafter it shapes us_.

Or (when we remove the linearity of it):

> _as we shape our society, it also shapes us_.

Here are two notions which impact the shape of a society:

1. Space - The opportunities/lack of opportunities to exercise
   [agency](http://www.zeespencer.com/articles/agency-society-and-invention/).
2. Structure - The support for/obstacles to exercising your agency.

## Space

Space could be considered the availability of resources; such as time, money,
information, tools, mentorship, etc. For those who read Tom DeMarco it is
similar to his definition of
[Slack](http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0932633617).

## Structure

Structure could be considered the rules, norms, physical constraints,
expectations, obligations, habits, or similar
[affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance).

## Their Relation

Space and Structure are related. The only way to adjust space is to adjust
structure. Given how impactful these things are, changes to structure should be
both intentional and thoughtful.

Some questions I like to consider when changing structure:

1. What unintended obstacles may this change introduce?
2. What supports may be at risk from this change?
3. What lessons learned from applying this structure to other groups may not
   apply here?
