title: Applying Heuristic Analysis to Test Code
tags: [usability, code, draft]

When talking about code, we like to toss around words like "expressive" or
"intent revealing" or "clean" or "well-structured."

This is often navel-gazing.

When discussing code, we coould adopt the same rigor that professional designers
use when discussing their creations. Most great designers don't use subjective
terms like "expressive" or "clean" to give feedback about their work. Sure, they
may use them to describe their overarching design goal: "A grungy interface that
evokes a counter-cultural feeling." When critiquing visual design they talk
about things like:
  * Alignment
  * Contrast
  * Proximity

And when discussing interactive design, they use things like:
  * Feedback
  * Feedforward
  * Prominince
