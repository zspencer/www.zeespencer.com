I was pairing with a friend of mine who has been working as a junior developer
for the past 6 months. We were reviewing and rewriting some of the code, and he
asked "I can see this is better, but how did you know to make these
changes?"

Well.

That's a hard question. I mumbled something about "Well, when you've been doing
this as long as I have..."

And that's a bullshit answer. While much of my judgement
comes from seeing what has worked and what didn't that's only part of
the story. There are deliberate actions I take to hone my judgement:

1. I Write throw-away code
1. I Surround myself with expertise
1. I Read. Constantly.
1. I Turn the knob to 11


### Write Throw-Away Code

Whether I'm working on a
[kata](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/) or a [breakable
toy](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys)
or even production software; I throw away most of the code I write. Why? Because
I know my first attempt is likely a poor attempt. I treat my first pass as a
["spike"](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html), or learning opportunity.

This gives me the freedom to experiment and explore without worrying about
introducing [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). In
short, safety to experiment is crucial for building judgement.

### Surround Yourself With Expertise

While I may think I'm pretty hot shit when it comes to software development, the
fact of the matter is that there are thousands of developers with more experience,
better judgement, and deeper understanding than I. Add in the sheer breadth of
specialities in software and it's pretty humbling.

I've spent the past 6 years building a network of people across a wide
range of specialities. From software testers to interaction designers to
operations engineers to machine learning scientists. When I have a
problem, I can simply send off an email or pose a question in IRC.

By investing in friendships across disciplines I can "outsource" my
judgement; often for the cost of a few beers or a cup of coffee.

### I Read. Constantly.

And not just books. Read code. Find small code bases that do specific things and
read and annotate them. Find large code bases and skim them. I regularly
practice diving into an unfamiliar project and figuring out what's going on.

This builds judgement by letting me see how people I've never even met solve
problems. It also builds my ability to understand unfamiliar code.

Not to undervalue books at all. I easily spend $500+ a year in technology books;
mostly when I'm learning a framework, language or tool. I tend to split tech
books into three categories: Overviews, Deep Dives, and Power Levelers.

Overviews familiarize me with a new concept or idea. These are often 50~200
pages; and act as a starting point. Chris Pine's [Learn
Programming](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram) is an example of this. At the end,
you've gained enough context to start to explore programming.

Deep Dives are firehoses of information. David Flanagan's [JavaScript the
Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do) is an
example of a deep dive. It's 400+ pages of brain-breaking goodness. These kind
of books are *for skimming*. Do *NOT* try to read them cover to cover. Read the
chapter headings, check out some examples, then pull them off the shelf when you
have a question. I really like to have these in digital form as that makes
searching much easier.

Power Levelers are targetted at a specific skill. They almost always assume a
reasonable familiarity with the topic at hand. Reginald Braithwaite's
[Javascript Allonges](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge) is an example of
this. If you haven't written javascript for a while, you'll likely not have the
context to grok why he's making the recommendations he does. These books are
often short, very dense, and are especially useful when you feel you've
plateaued in a given area.

### Turn The Knob To 11

Turning the knob to 11 is when you take a very specific concept; and over-apply
it. I often do this in combination with writing throw away code. Over-applying a
technique or technology is the easiest way to find its shortcomings. Want to
learn to TDD? TDD *everything* for a year. At the end you'll have a solid
understanding of when to and when not to TDD.

I love turning the knob to;11; but since it is directly intended to discover
where something breaks down it may not be a good idea to apply it to production
code.

### Judgement Makes Perfect

Practice makes permanent, feedback and judgement makes perfect. Reflect on
your work. Intentionally seek the edges of your skills. This is how you move
beyond junior.
