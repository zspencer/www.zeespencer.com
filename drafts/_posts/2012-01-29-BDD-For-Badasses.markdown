BDD! Woahhhh, that\'s like, so caaaraazzzzy! Like, describing your application
behavior with executable specifications! Then using that description to drive
your codes design! That sounds like madness!

When the do you do it? How do you do it well? What are the different scenarios
for \'mocking/stubbing/spying?\' How do you BDD at the unit level? Integration
level? What\'s the difference between outside in BDD and inside out BDD? When do
you do either?

This is a live coding session. Code is written demonstrating the different
possible answers to each of these questions.
