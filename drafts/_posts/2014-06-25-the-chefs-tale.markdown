Once upon a time there was a Chef. This Chef was sought after by all of the
kings and queens and emperors and empresses to plan and create their feasts.
They ferried this Chef from castle to castle; awestruck at the culinary
creations set before them.

One day, a pair of scullery workers asked The Chef their secret. "My children,"
The Chef replied, "I have no secret. I wake up each day. I plan what I will
make. I make it. I review how it went. When things don't go well, learn from
it. When things go well, I learn from that as well."

"But surely," one child contended, "surely one with such renowned and creative
dishes must have a secret ingredient! Perhaps dust of a unicorn horn? Dragons
blood? Fairy hair?"

"In fact it is not! When I wish to explore a dish, I try it many different
ways. I make it for week upon week. I modify the ingredients. I alter timing. I
change the cooking temperature. I seek  to understand every detail of the dish,
while cooking and eating it every day.

If I did not make a finished meal, I would go hungry! If I were to ignore the
process, I would not learn! There is no secret, only hard work and discipline."

As the children returned to work, one mocked The Chef. "The Chef wants all the
fame and glory for themselves! There must be a secret ingredient!"

"I don't know..." said the other. "Perhaps tomorrow I shall make my meal."
