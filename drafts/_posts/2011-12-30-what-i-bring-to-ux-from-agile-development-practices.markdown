tags: [articles, drafts]

Unless you\'ve been living under a rock, you\'ve probably heard about this
\"agile\" thing that is \"all the rage\" and \"oh so incredible.\"

The bad news is capital-A Agile can be pretty terrible when it comes to
interaction design. Sometime\'s Agile proponents declare \"design up front is
bad\" and \"everything worth doing must be converted into software within two
weeks.\"

The good news is once you get past the towering bubble of hype and rhetoric you
discover the principles espoused at the core of agile methodologies are not
antithetical to interaction design at all. In fact, they\'re oddly complementary
and often parralel to the most powerful interaction design principles.
