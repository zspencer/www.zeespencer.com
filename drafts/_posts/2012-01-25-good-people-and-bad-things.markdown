Recently I saw a few tweets go by my stream about a node package written by
Heather Arthur that replaces a couple built in Unix packages. The comments were
highly critical and made by a couple of my friends, Corey Haines and Steve
Klabnik.

Heather discovered the tweets and was justifiably hurt by them.  She wrote a
blog post and both Corey and Steve posted apologies.

I know both Steve and Corey. I know they're compassionate, thoughtful, and
considerate people. I don't know Heather, but she seems like a hard working,
intelligent, and friendly person.

They're all just that. People. As people share a few common attributes:

* We share our ideas
* We care about things
* We make mistakes
* We react to pain
* We learn from the past
* etc.

This set of attributes when taken individually or as a group can be very
beneficial. My experiences with stoves at an early age taught me to be careful
with them. They can also be less beneficial, as my roommates will explain that
I've never really learned to cook.

I've no doubt that this experience is being added to the things Corey, Steve,
and Heather learned from. I hope none of them choose to retreat from our
community, I hope all of them get to know each other and strengthen their
relationships, and I hope the rest of us take some time to think about how we
can react more positively to the painful experiences in our lives.
