title: Project Management Isn't Rocket Surgery

It's funny, really. We think project management is this incredibly complicated
thing. We track all activities, the different 'resources' (aka people) doing the
work, the cost, and the timeline.

Really though, a project is composed of three things:
* The outcomes or objectives it is supposed to accomplish/reach
* The outputs that can be used to validate the objectives
* The inputs that create the outputs

Unfortunately, these three things can not be mapped directly to one another. The
amount of time and money that is spent on something rarely correlates to the
desired outcomes. In many cases the time and money spent do not even correlate
to the desired work outputs! 

These rather unfortunate happenings force me to conclude that project
management, as a whole, is a broken practice. I don't have some magical solution
that will solve it, I only believe that the majority of the teaching that is
propagated around it is, plain and simply, bunk.

Instead of magic charts and graphs and fancy tools for validating you have the
appropriate people assigned for maximum efficiency I recommend the following
solution:

1. Create a list of the things that may create your desired outcomes.
2. Remove anything that may not create the desired outcomes.
3. Observe the rate at which these things are accomplished.
4. Measure their impact upon your desired outcomes.
5. Alter your course.
6. Repeat. 

This strategy has many disadvantages, the most terrifying of which is
uncertainty. 

Certainty is like the giant fluffy pillow you jump into every
night as you prepare for bed. Sure, it's comfy; but it may smother you in your
sleep. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is the monster under your bed. You know
it's there. Lurking. Waiting ever so patiently to devour you the instant you
don't have your mom check before she turns out the lights.

Here's an unfortunate fact: More people die from pillow smothering than
nocturnal monster attacks. 

So don't have your daddy check behind the dresser. Accept uncertainty. Be
willing to acknowledge that you can't know if your project will achieve it's
desired outcomes.

Once you step back a bit, start focusing on the goals, and trust that the
bogeyman isn't out to get you you'll discover that you can actually get shit
done and start making something that matters.
