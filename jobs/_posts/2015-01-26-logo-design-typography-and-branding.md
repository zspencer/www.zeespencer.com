ZincMade is a recently incorporated business focused on technical team training,
end-to-end product development, and technical management consulting. We are
investing in a solid foundation for our branding. To do so, we are looking for a
designer to provide logo design, typography choices, and color selection
services.

The resulting brand will reflect the following values:

* Simplicity
* High-quality
* Thoughtfulness
* Feedback-driven

### Is This Gig For You?

The ideal designer:

* Has a solid portfolio of logos and brand designs.
* Asks great questions to get the right kind of feedback they need to make a
  great design.
* Is comfortable managing a feedback-centric workflow to refine and hone a
  design.
* Is comfortable time-boxing their work.


### The Results I Expect

The output of this work would be:

* A logo suitable for printing on square or round buttons, stickers, etc.
* A logo suitable for use as a banner on a website or in other situations where
  a rectangular logo is preferred.
* Adobe Illustrator or Affinity Designer source files for the logo
* A color-pallete for high-contrast reading that degrades gracefully for
  color-blindness
* A selection of fonts, with weights and sizes suitable for rendering on the
  web.


### What Is The Budget?

Our budget is approximately $2,000 USD, with some wiggle room. This is an
inception for a small business, so unfortunately there's not a huge budget.

I am comfortable paying for usage rights of fonts, ideally under $250 for a
license that allows unlimited print and digital use.

### To Apply

Email <a class="job-application-email" href="mailto:
zee+zincmadebranding@zeespencer.com">zee+zincmadebranding@zeespencer.com</a> a
proposal with:

1. Your portfolio.
2. A set of questions that you would like answered about the work.
3. Your timeline of availability.
4. An approximate quote for the project.

Thank you! I look forward to working with you!
