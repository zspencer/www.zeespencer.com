Zee loves to make things and teach people. He blends a focus on experience
design, technical practice, and lean project management into a version of
software akido. This allows him to help teams learn to consistently deliver more
of what matters.

When not making software Zee jams with friends, rock climbs,  and watches an
absurd amount of science fiction.
