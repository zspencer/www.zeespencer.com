They illustrate *how to use* the code they're testing.

They are a *detailed description* of how the code behaves.

They provide *examples* of how the code works in a given context.

They highlight *pain-points* in how to use the code.

They expose *complexity* in our model of the problem domain.

When they *notify us* the code no longer behaves as specified? That's a bonus.
Not the goal.

When we do not write tests, we *miss a key component* of design feedback.
