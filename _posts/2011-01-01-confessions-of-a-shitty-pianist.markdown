  title: Confessions of a Shitty Pianist
---
I\'m a shitty pianist.

When I was young I practiced daily, studied theory, explored composers and genres, and composed my own music.

This helped me become a badass pianist.

Then I stopped practicing, experimenting, exploring, and creating.

Now I\'m a shitty pianist.

**We can not be exceptional when we rarely practice, study, explore, or create.**
