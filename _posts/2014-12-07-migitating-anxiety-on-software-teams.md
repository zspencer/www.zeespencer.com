Software development is a creative pursuit. It takes intense focus and time away
from the problem to for your subconscious to work. Both of these cognitive modes
are easily affected by stress and anxiety.

One of the major sources of anxiety is uncertainty. Uncertainy is almost always
deeply personal, and may be about many things:

* Are we earning enough to live comfortably?
* Are we compensated fairly for our time, effort and skills?
* Are our skills improving in a worth-while direction at a reasonable rate?
* Are we learning what we want to learn?
* Is our work of a good quality?
* How do others perceive us? (Especially those we respect or in positions of authority.)
* Is our work environment comfortable and condusive to our work style?
* Does our work matter?
* And many, many more.


For those of you familiar with the writings of [Daniel
Pink](http://www.danpink.com), you may be already mapping these to his three
drivers for motivation: mastery, autonomy, and purpose. This is because anxiety
saps our motivation. It hampers our ability to execute by draining our conscious
and sub-concious attention, and may dissuade us from applying any effort.

In a well-adjusted software team, we make an effort to:

* Understand the anxieties we face individually and as a group.
* Take concrete steps to address and alleviate specific anxieties.
* Advocate for and make systemic changes which mitigate these anxieties.

Our responses to how anxiety manifests are often personal as well. There's no
"one size fits all" approach that ensures people to maintain a state of flow
unhindered by uncertainty and anxiety; however there are some things that have
significant bearing:

* Compensation
* Education
* Information

### Compensation

Anxieties rooted in finances are often sticky. People feel uncomfortable
discussing money, and companies prefer to keep personnel costs low. This is
especially true in software teams, which almost always have most of their budget
devoted to salaries and benefits.

Some companies are taking radical steps, such as [using a salary
formula](http://www.management30.com/workout/salary-formula/) and [publicly
publishing salary
data](https://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/).
I'm personally not 100% sold on this level of transparency, but I agree it's a
really powerful way to address perceived fairness. Here are a few other steps
to reduce anxiety and maintain high levels of creativity, attention, and
motivation:


* Pay people well and fairly, regardless of role. This helps avoid a role
  hierarchy. Role hierarchies cause people to resent or disdain between people
  in roles in different pay levels, especially when there's a large disconnect
  between the kind of work being done.
* Don't trade "culture" for compensation. Sure office toys and work-cations are
  fun, but it doesn't put food on the table; and they [can cause unintended
  division](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/how-perks-can-divide-us)
  perks taking priority over respect.
* Don't over-sell equity. Future income doesn't alleviate current financial
  pressure. A high-value on equity may encourage distrust, since the founders,
  executives or board members "selling" the equity tend to over-value it.


### Education

Many software professionals are driven by our ability to create. We want to see
our abilities deepen and learn complementary skills. At the same time, we fear
our work is sub-par or we [don't
belong](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/morty-lefkoe/do-you-suffer-from-the-im_b_4791763.html).

While we can't guarantee the language or framework we're using will continue to
be in fashion, we can:

* Provide a set of expectations about what skills are valued in a given role. By
  explicitely defining what makes a "Senior" engineer vs. a "Junior" one, we
  create a mirror for people to look into and self-evaluate that the skills they
  have are valuable.
* Focus on fundamentals and core skills, instead of frameworks and technologies.
  New techniques, libraries, and concepts come and go in the software world. By
  encouraging people to level up their core skills we create current and future safety.
* Support new ideas and techniques. Discouraging teammates from trying out a new
  technology or user research technique is an easy way to cause self-doubt and
  anxiety.
* Support learning. Encourage reading at work. Provide a budget for
  self-improvement that doesn't have to be spent on going to a conference.
  Support people in the things *they* want to learn, not just the things a
  company deems worthwhile.


### Information

Layoffs and re-organizations are almost always a source of anxiety. Buffer has a
very interesting approach of [publicizing their financial data every
month](https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-november-update-2347000-run-rate-1189000-users/).
While, again, this may not work for every business; providing reliable
information that builds trust among the people in the business is crucial. Some
anxiety inducing questions are:

* Are our sales healthy?
* Is there a connection between the work we're doing and customer
  satisfaction/financial stability?
* What are the risks people see and how are we avoiding them?
* Are there up-coming organizational changes that may affect how I do my work?

How each company addresses these kinds of questions is tough. No matter how you
choose to do so, there's a few tactics that are very effective:

* Terseness is a virtue. Long meandering reports of supporting data is more
  interesting for the person doing the analysis than the people effected by it.
* Make it consumable asyncronously. Being able to read and review information at
  ones own convenience is a huge step in reducing anxiety.
* Consistency is huge. Consistency in both delivery and type of information
  presented helps people establish trends.
* _Don't mandate it_. Not everyone wants all the information or even the same
  information. Distributing knowledge via  a mandatory meeting can cast people
  who are already confident as disengaged.


Providing financial stability, direction and time for improving skills, and
knowledge about the current and likely future state of a company all go a long
way in freeing up a teams mental capacity. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how
anxiety and uncertainty affects software teams!
