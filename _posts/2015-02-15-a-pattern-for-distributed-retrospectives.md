Well-facilitated, compassionate
[retrospectives](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649)
(the practice of taking time to discuss how to improve the effectiveness of a
team) are, in my experience, the core differentiator between a gelling,
high-performing team and a team that struggles to get things done.

<p class="note">
Retrospectives, while powerful, may not be the ideal format for working out
interpersonal conflict, as they require a high degree of trust to be effective.

Now that I work primarily on distributed teams, I've found that retrospectives
are a touch harder. They lack the high-bandwidth feedback of body language that
can tell you early on when someone is getting upset or has something to say but
isn't quite ready to say it.

A pattern that seems to work is to do distributed retrospectives in near
silence.

"Wait!" you may be saying. "Near silence?"

Yep! Silence! [Silence is a powerful way to create space for
thoughtfulness](https://vimeo.com/114703856). It gives team-members who may
struggle to express themselves verbally a chance to clearly express their
thoughts.

Here's the recipe I follow when facilitating distributed retrospectives:

#### Ingredients
* 1 whole team. This team consists of everyone doing or guiding the work.
* 1 shared-workspace. I like [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) for it's
  group-chat, "suggesting" mode, and familiar interface.
  [Trello](http://trello.com) and [cardboardit](https://www.cardboardit.com)
  are also effective.
* 1 retrospective [facilitation pattern](http://www.funretrospectives.com). I
  prefer "[Keep Doing/Start Doing/Stop Doing/Do More/Do
  Less](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Start,_Stop,_Continue,_More_of,_Less_of_Wheel)"
  as it's relatively easy to use.

#### Directions
* Open with the [Retrospective Prime
  Directive](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html).
* Fill in initial topics of discussion for five to ten minutes. Once the adding
  process slows down...
* Spend about five minutes adding comments and asking clarifying questions *in
  the document.* Try to only use your voice to bring attention to a comment in
  the document. Mixin some up-votes and "+1"'s.
* Start the discussion with the most active topics.
* Spend about five minutes per-topic adding *specific actions to take* on the
  topic. This is a great time for topic requesters or people with strong
  opinions to share them.
* With about fifteen minutes left, ask participants to select a reasonable set
  of actions they, personally are going to take. Ask participants to add these
  actions to the project tracking system.
* With about five minutes left, ask the group to take a moment to popcorn
  style share something they'd like to celebrate with the group, or something
  they'd like to get advice about outside the meeting.
* Close with gratitude and celebration!

*Serves remote teams of 2 to 20 (and maybe more)*
