BDD?! That's crazy! Describing an application's behavior with executable
specifications?! Using those specifications to drive your codes' design?!
Madness!

What? It's not madness? It's actually an incredibly powerful technique that
helps simple solutions emerge organically? OK. Maybe I'm interested; but first
you've got to prove it!

In this live coding session, I'll demonstrate some of the power of BDD to drive
out a solution to a coding problem. Along the way, I hope to answer the
following questions:

* When do you do it?
* How do you do it well?
* What are the different scenarios for 'mocking/stubbing/spying?'
* How do you BDD at the unit level?
* Integration level?
* What's the difference between outside in BDD and inside out BDD?
* When do you do either?
