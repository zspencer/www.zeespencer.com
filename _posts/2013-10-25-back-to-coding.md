The last 9 months have been some of the most amazing, fullfilling, enjoyable
months I've ever had.

I've been lucky enough to teach nearly 150 hard working, passionate people the
basics of development and help launch their career in a field I love.

This has consumed every ounce of my energy, so I'm looking forward to taking
time to recharge, relax, and **build some software**.

#### I can provide:

1. Some competence at writing useful, clean code
2. Mentoring for developers, project/product managers, or interaction designers
3. Horrible puns

#### I'm looking for:

1. A distributed team to work with
2. For 10~30 hours a week
3. To build something hard/fun/meaningful

If you are interested, I'd love to chat. My email is
