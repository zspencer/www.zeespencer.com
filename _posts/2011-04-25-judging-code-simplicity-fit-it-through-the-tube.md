We coders have all kinds of definitions of simple code. To some, simple code is
code they understand and read easily. Others believe simple code follows the
coolest, most appropriate design pattern. Some say simple code has the fewest
characters.

Extreme Programming tries to setttle that debate by offering [four qualities of
simple code](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html): testability,
browsability, understandability, and explainabilty.

To make these qualities easier to remember I coin the mnemonic TUBE.

### Testable
Can automated tests be written for each piece of functionality and permutation
of behavior? Are there positive *and* negative use-cases?

### Understandable
When you read a function, does it do what you expected given it's method
signature? How long does it take to figure out what the code does?

### Browsable
Can the code be browsed in an IDE? How quickly does someone who didn’t write the
code find what they're looking for?

### Explainable
I'm pretty sure this is here twice because it's so important. Can a different
developer tell you what the code does? Does their explanation match yours?

If your code meets these criteria, congratulations! Your code fits in the TUBE,
and when the TUBE fits, make commits!
