excerpt: Junior developers have a unique struggle. How can they know when
         they're "good enough" to be a non-junior developer? How can they move
         quickly from the novice or advanced beginner level and into competent?

I was pairing with a friend of mine who is working as a junior developer. We
were reviewing and rewriting some of the code, and he asked "I can see this is
better, but how did you know to do it?"

Well.

That's a hard question. I mumbled something about "When you've been doing
this as long as I have..."

And that's a bullshit answer.

Much of my judgement comes from seeing what has worked and what didn't; yet
that's only part of the story. I take several deliberate actions to hone my
judgement:

1. I Write throw-away code
1. I Surround myself with expertise
1. I Read. Constantly.
1. I Turn the knob to 11


### Write Throw-Away Code

Whether I'm working on a
[kata](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/) or a [breakable
toy](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys)
or even production software; I throw away most of the code I write. Why? Because
my first attempt is a poor attempt. I use my first pass as a
["spike"](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html), a kind of
hands-on learning opportunity.

This gives me the freedom to experiment and explore without worrying about
adding unnecessary [technical
debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). This lets me go off the
beaten path a bit and try things I never would have if I knew it had to go into
production. Sure, some of these experiments are dead ends; but they invariably
provide me with more information about how to solve the kind of problem I'm
working in.

Safety to experiment is crucial for building judgement.

### Surround Yourself With Expertise

While I may think I'm pretty hot shit when it comes to software development, the
fact of the matter is that there are thousands of developers with more experience,
better judgement, and deeper understanding than I. Add in the sheer breadth of
specialities in software and it's pretty overwhelming. And humbling!

I've spent the past 6 years building a network of people across a wide range of
specialities. From software testers to interaction designers to operations
engineers to machine learning scientists. When I have a problem, I can send off
an email or aks a question in IRC or Twitter.

By investing in friendships across disciplines I "outsource" my judgement. This
helps me build judgement in a new territory quickly and effectively.

### Read. Constantly.

And not just books. Read code. Find small code bases that do specific things and
read and annotate them. Find large code bases and skim them. I regularly
practice diving into an unfamiliar project and figuring out what's going on.

This builds judgement by letting me see how people I've never even met solve
problems. It also builds my ability to understand unfamiliar code.

Not to undervalue books at all. I easily spend $500+ a year in technology books;
mostly when I'm learning a framework, language or tool.

### Turn The Knob To 11

Turning the knob to 11 is when you take a very specific concept; and over-apply
it. Over-applying a technique or technology is the easiest way to find its
shortcomings. Want to learn to TDD? TDD *everything* for a year. At the end
you'll have a solid understanding of when to and when not to TDD.

I love turning the knob to 11; but since it is directly intended to discover
where something breaks down it isn't always a good practice to apply to
production code.

### Judgement Makes Perfect

Practice makes permanent, feedback and judgement makes perfect. Reflect on
your work. Intentionally seek the edges of your skills. This is how you move
beyond junior.
