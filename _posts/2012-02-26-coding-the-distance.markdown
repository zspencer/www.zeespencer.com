Reluctantly crouched at the command line<br />
Keyboards clicking and clacking in time<br />
The green bar flashes, the vim pops up<br />
Churning, and burning, they push changes up<br />
They deftly maneuver and regex to rename<br />
Fingers flying fast keyboards in flame<br />
Reckless and wild, they commit and they push<br />
<!--more-->
Their prowess is potent though they sit on their tush.<br />
As they speed through the release, the deploy goes out<br />
They all get up and pour themselves stout<br />
The team room is empty except for one man<br />
Still coding, and typing, as fast as he can<br />
The sun has gone down and the moon come up<br />
And long ago he's emptied his coffee cup<br />
But he's coding, and typing, and stubbing things out<br />
And hacking up a feature customers are raving about<br />

He's deploying continuous<br />
He's deploying with speed<br />
She's all alone<br />
In her time of need<br />

Because he's hacking and cracking and refactoring obsessed<br />
He's fighting and typing and running his specs<br />
He's deploying continuous<br />

No bonus, no vacay, no pressrelease, no wine<br />
He's haunted by something he cannot define<br />
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse<br />
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force.<br />
In his mind, he's still coding, still making the grade<br />
She's hoping in time that her memories will fade.<br />

Because he's hacking and cracking and refactoring obsessed<br /><br />
He's fighting and typing and running his specs<br />
the sun has gone down and the moon come up<br />
and long ago he's emptied his coffee cup<br />
But he's coding, and typing, and stubbing things out<br />
And hacking up a feature customers are raving about<br />

He's deploying continuous<br />
He's deploying with speed<br />
She's all alone<br />
In her time of need<br />

Because he's hacking and cracking and moving to the next<br />
He's fighting and typing and running his specs<br />
he's hacking and cracking and moving to the next<br />
He's fighting and typing and running his specs<br />

He's deploying continuous<br />
He's deploying for speed<br />
He's deploying continuous<br />
