Tests are use cases.

They illustrate **how to use** the code they're testing.

They provide **examples** of how the code works in a given context.

They are a **describe in detail** the code's behavior.

They **highlight pain** in how to use the code.

They **expose complexity** in our model of the business domain.

When they **notify us** the code no longer behaves as specified? That's a bonus.
Not the goal.

When we test, we get **critical design feedback**.

When we use tests to explore and refine our code's design, we **create nuanced,
educational conversations**.

**Well-designed code lets us take advantage of opportunities** that would
otherwise be out of reach.

When we take advantage of unexpected opportunities, we **create value**.

This is why I test. There may be other reasons, but these are mine.

Why do you test? Care to <a class="feedback-email" href="mailto: zee@wecohere.com">Share your
reasons?</a>

I help teams learn effective testing practices in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, and
Clojure. If this sounds like something you're interested in, <a
