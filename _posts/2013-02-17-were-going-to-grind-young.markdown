I hear your heart beat from all that caffeine<br />
Oh, what a shame there's not more in your bloodstream<br />
So while you're here in my cafe<br />
Let's make the most of the beans that we're gonna grind young<br />

We're gonna grind young<br />
We're gonna grind young<br />

Let's make the most of the beans like we're gonna grind young<br />
Let's make the most of the beans like we're gonna grind young<br />

Young beans, fresh from the trees<br />
As they roast the aroma frees<br />
That roast's lookin' good<br />
Getting darker just like it should<br />
Don't care who's watching when we cooking' it up (You Know)<br />
That magic that we got nobody can touch (For sure)<br />

Looking for some espresso tonight (yeah)<br />
Take my cup, I'll show you the wild, side<br />
Like it's the last roast of our lives (uh huh)<br />
We'll keep brewing 'til we die<br />

Young baristas, making shots<br />
Heating up the vacuum pots<br />
Steaming up, gettin' hot<br />
Fill me, give me all you've got<br />
It's pretty obvious that you've got a crush (you know)<br />
That magic in our hands, it's making you flush (for sure)<br />
