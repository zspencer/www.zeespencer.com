She chrouches, alert and ready.<br />
Waves crash across the bow.<br />
She clenches the mast tightly<br />
She furrows up her brow.<br />
Winds roar with fury<br />
Waves whip to foam<br />
All other beach-goers<br />
Turn their faces home.<br />

Not the lone windsurfer.<br />
Cold and wind combine<br />
To turn _wretched weather_<br />
Into an ideal time.<br />
She leans, She twists, She catches<br />
A roaring, potent gust<br />
She skips across the ocean<br />
She leaves birds in the dust.<br/>


<br />
_Embrace those opportunities which arise from discomfort. They may contain a secret joy_
<br />
