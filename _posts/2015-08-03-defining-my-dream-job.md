About a year ago I got back into freelancing and started building a small,
distributed development studio. While I enjoyed the freedom and the people; I
couldn't sustain the constant sales cycle and discovered management and
operations is a recipe for burnout for me. My constant anxiety over payroll,
bookkeeping and cashflow was/is debilitating.

I could write in depth about what I've learned about myself and running a
business over the past year; or describe the agony of laying off good people who
may struggle to find new work due to systemic bias; or tipping into depression
due to a combination of burnout and the erosion of my self-confidence. But
instead I'd like to look forward. It's less painful.

It is time to shut down the consultancy side of Zinc. Zinc will remain focused
on [The Apprenticeship Community](https://apprenticeship.community) and [Just
Enough Media](https://leanpub.com/u/justenoughmedia). We've ramped down our
delivery team, and while most have found new homes already; if you're a
pairing company looking for junior and/or senior javascript / ruby developers
[ping me](mailto:zee@zeespencer.com).

This also means I am officially looking for full or part-time work; and do not
intend to continue consulting (at least, not primarily as a deliverer of
software).

What would hiring me do for your team? My entire career has been built by
combining a reasonable level of proficiency at shipping working software with
the ability to to create opportunity for those around me to improve their
skills.

My undying passion is helping teams and people become more effective. While I love
working closely with a team of compassionate, curious, cross-skilled peers
building solid software that meets customers needs and has a high degree of
technical quality; my greatest love is helping people plan, execute, and
reflect on their professional growth.

My ideal job consists of working with varied teams that recognize the
value of people of different backgrounds, skill levels, and perspectives. The
antithesis of the ego driven, senior obsessed, "We hire the best"
[mirrortocracy](http://carlos.bueno.org/2014/06/mirrortocracy.html).

I want to focus on guiding and facilitating peer mentorship and intentional
professional growth. I disagree completely with the notion that professional
growth "happens naturally." It takes intentional investment in time and money.
It requires recognition that social and personal structures are a critical part
of a learning culture.

This isn't to say I won't be coding. Collaborating on projects is required to
understand someone and assist them in planning their growth. I want
contributions to be evaluated not by features shipped or tasks completed but by
my fellow-workers ability to plan, observe and measure their professional
growth.

If I were to write my own job description, it would look something like this:

* Organizes and facilitates retrospectives, open-spaces, and other
  peer-learning activities.
* [Mob programs](http://mobprogramming.org) with teams and pair programs with
  individuals with an emphasis on gleaning understanding and reflection while
  doing work.
* Facilitates one-on-one and/or small group learning planning and reflection.
* Ships software as part of a set of teams, with an emphasis on
  cross-polination.

Alternatively, I'd be happy to work with a company that can demonstrate that
these responsibilities are taken care of already.

I can subsist as an independent freelancer indefinitely; and will continue to
do so until I find the right place. How would I describe this place?

1. It recognizes the insiduous, destructive nature of micro-aggressions and
   sublte \*isms and considers compassion a core skill.
2. It has inoculated itself against "senior-coder-itis" and actively hires
   across skill levels and specializations; while paying equitable salaries.
3. It prioritizes perks such as 401(k)s, trans-inclusive health care, and
   sustainable pace over ping pong tables and free beer.
4. It is based somewhere with good mass transit; or allows remote work. I'm
   currently based out of Oakland, California and am highly interested in
   Montreal, Quebec.
