      <h2>Effective Code Critique</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>Code review gets a bad rap. People worry that code reviews slow teams down,
create conflict between team members, or disempower team members by taking away
decision making authority.</p>

<p>I believe these concers are anti-patterns that indicate a team is using code
review for <em>criticism</em> as opposed to <em>critique</em>. What&#39;s the difference?
<em>Critique is focused on  specific parameters, where criticism is unbound.</em></p>

<p>That said, many programmers are unclear how to perform judgement free code
reviews. The following are a series of suggestions which may help move code
reviews from criticism to critique:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#start-with-compassion">Start with compassion</a></li>
<li><a href="#working-code-wins">Working code wins</a></li>
<li><a href="#discuss-clarity,-coupling,-cohesion,-and-encapsulation">Discuss clarity, coupling, cohesion, and encapsulation</a></li>
<li><a href="#celebrate-intentionally">Celebrate intentionally</a></li>
<li><a href="#follow-up">Follow up</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="start-with-compassion">Start With Compassion</h2>

<p>I like to begin each review by reflecting on the context of the person
submitting the code. Are they experienced team members or novices? Do you have
good rapport with them? Are they under schedule or personal or professional
pressure?</p>

<p>I follow that up by reminding myself of a variation on the retrospective prime
directive; the submitter is doing the best they can given their past experiences
and current context. This isn&#39;t to say the work is above reproach; but that the
submitter is doing the best they can.</p>

<h2 id="working-code-wins">Working Code Wins</h2>

<p>Code review may be used as a gate to prevent technically concerning code from
entering the system. This is a flawed approach to code review as it introduces
an unpredictable amount of latency in a workflow and implies distrust. I prefer
to allow anyone to merge the code right away, so long as the merger has
confidence that the change causes benefits from the user or business
perspective. I ask myself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I understand the goals of the change?</li>
<li>Does it meet my understanding of user or business needs?</li>
<li>What are the changes potential unintended side effects?</li>
<li>Does the change update the user facing documentation?</li>
<li>Do tests demonstrate the features functionality? These don&#39;t need to go
through the UI, especialls when there&#39;s reasonable confidence in the code
connecting the interface to the feature.</li>
<li>Is there an image, gif, or video demonstrating the feature in use attached
to the change? This makes it much easier for team members to evaluate the
change from a users perspective.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the code can be said to be working; then it may be merged ASAP. Further code
review for a piece of work may continue <em>past</em> the change being released into
production.</p>

<p>Allowing anyone to carry forward or merge a change at any time encourages low
cycle times, high flow, and tight collaboration between team members.</p>

<h2 id="discuss-clarity-coupling-cohesion-and-encapsulation">Discuss Clarity, Coupling, Cohesion, and Encapsulation</h2>

<p>Code reviews often focus on style over substance. I prefer to use linters or
automated style checkers in the build to pre-empt stylistic comments. This frees
up team members to focus on how a change impacts maintainability of the sofware.
The four aspects I focus on are clarity, coupling, cohesion, and encapsulation.</p>

<h3 id="clarity-what-does-this-code-mean">Clarity - What Does This Code Mean?</h3>

<p>Clarity is all about names, documentation, tests, types, etc. Clear code helps
future maintainers to understand the intent of the code as well as the
implementation. Are commit messages and notes coherent? Are the names of
variables and methods reasonable? Are there usage examples? Are types or shapes
of data demonstrated or enforced?</p>

<p>Unclear code indicates a change lacks cohesion, has unnecessary coupling, or
poorly encapsulates the goal of the change. By paying attention to the clarity,
we make it easier to pick up the code and make changes later on.</p>

<h3 id="coupling-what-does-this-code-work-with">Coupling - What Does This Code Work With?</h3>

<p>Coupling is when changes to other components may require changes in this section
of code. How many external collaborators are used to do the work?  How deeply
does this code reach into it&#39;s collaborators? How many of their functions are
being used? In cases where coupling with external collaborators is both wide and
deep it can be valuable to write an intermediary to wrap the collaborators and
expose a smaller surface area to the new code.</p>

<p>By drawing attention to coupling, we may reduce the likelihood that we&#39;ll have
to change this code when another component changes.</p>

<h3 id="encapsulation-how-will-others-use-this-code">Encapsulation - How Will Others Use This Code?</h3>

<p>While coupling is how a component interacts with outside collaborators;
encapsulation is how outside consumers interact with a given component. One
indicator of a loosely encapsulated component is difficulty in testing. A
component that is hard to test is difficult to use. This is likely because the
the code unintentionally exposes it&#39;s implementation. Sometimes the difficulty
in testing is hidden behind test helpers; where a more effective approach may be
to improve the interface of the component itself.</p>

<p>Long argument lists, callbacks, option hashes with required keys, and parameter
objects are all indicators of loose encapsulation. In many cases these are
completely reasonable; after all reducing the surface area of an interface
likely diminishes it&#39;s utility. In other cases, it&#39;s a sign the component may
be doing too much.</p>

<p>When we draw attention to codes encapsulation during review, it creates an
opportunity to simplify interfaces and decrease the cost of re-using the
component.</p>

<h3 id="cohesion-what-is-the-codes-job">Cohesion - What Is The Codes Job?</h3>

<p>The clearest example of non-cohesive code is a horror story from my youth.
There was a SQL query which had hardcoded values it would return in order to
change the color of a label. The argument could be made that this encapsulated
the behavior of the feature; but in doing so it mixed the responsibility of
retrieving data with the responsibility of presenting the data. Cohesive code
eschews additional responsibilities wherever it can; resulting in horizontal
layers and vertical slices.</p>

<p>By drawing attention to the cohesion of code we create opportunities to improve
clarity by grouping related functionality and un-grouping un-related
functionality. This un-related functionality may become either a collaborator or a
consumer of the component it was extracted from.</p>

<p>When we frame our code review in terms of clarity, coupling, encapsulation, and
cohesion we change the focus from the programmer and place it squarely on the
artifact. It also moves us out of the world of moral judgement such as what&#39;s
the &quot;best&quot; way to do something and into a conversation about the
tradeoffs that we make as we build a software system together.</p>

<h2 id="celebrate-intentionally">Celebrate Intentionally</h2>

<p>Despite our best intentions; no matter how well a code review goes it is still
a high pressure situation for the submitter. No matter how I try, I still feel
a bit sad when someone critiques my code. To counter the inevitable bummer of
critical feedback I try to comment on parts of the code that are of high quality
or teach me something. It can also help to use celebratory emoji.</p>

<p>The important part is to always be genuine in your celebration; as it is often
impossible to discern between sarcasm or mockery and genuine excitement or
positivity. Especially for people who struggle to value their own contributions
already.</p>

<h2 id="follow-up">Follow Up</h2>

<p>If there&#39;s valuable changes to be made from code review but the work was merged
already; it&#39;s OK to add the desired changes in your task or project tracking
system. I generally prefer that the team has sole discretion on when to
complete those tasks; as they&#39;ll have a better understanding of the cost of
delaying clean up as well as the impact that maintainability improvements will
have on short and long term goals.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, I believe a compassionate, critique-oriented code review practice
results in high quality code and allows companies to include team members who
struggle with pair or mob programming.</p>

      <h2>The Rationale Behind Testing</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>Tests are use cases.</p>

<p>They illustrate <strong>how to use</strong> the code they&#39;re testing.</p>

<p>They provide <strong>examples</strong> of how the code works in a given context.</p>

<p>They are a <strong>describe in detail</strong> the code&#39;s behavior.</p>

<p>They <strong>highlight pain</strong> in how to use the code.</p>

<p>They <strong>expose complexity</strong> in our model of the business domain.</p>

<p>When they <strong>notify us</strong> the code no longer behaves as specified? That&#39;s a bonus.
Not the goal.</p>

<p>When we test, we get <strong>critical design feedback</strong>.</p>

<p>When we use tests to explore and refine our code&#39;s design, we <strong>create nuanced,
educational conversations</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Well-designed code lets us take advantage of opportunities</strong> that would
otherwise be out of reach.</p>

<p>When we take advantage of unexpected opportunities, we <strong>create value</strong>.</p>

<p>This is why I test. There may be other reasons, but these are mine.</p>

<p>I was pairing with a friend of mine who is working as a junior developer. We
were reviewing and rewriting some of the code, and he asked &quot;I can see this is
better, but how did you know to do it?&quot;</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a hard question. I mumbled something about &quot;When you&#39;ve been doing
this as long as I have...&quot;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s a bullshit answer.</p>

<p>Much of my judgement comes from seeing what has worked and what didn&#39;t; yet
that&#39;s only part of the story. I take several deliberate actions to hone my
judgement:</p>

<ol>

<h3 id="write-throw-away-code">Write Throw-Away Code</h3>

<p>Whether I&#39;m working on a
<a href="http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/">kata</a> or a <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys">breakable
toy</a>
or even production software; I throw away most of the code I write. Why? Because
my first attempt is a poor attempt. I use my first pass as a
<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html">&quot;spike&quot;</a>, a kind of
hands-on learning opportunity.</p>

<p>This gives me the freedom to experiment and explore without worrying about
adding unnecessary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical
debt</a>. This lets me go off the
beaten path a bit and try things I never would have if I knew it had to go into
production. Sure, some of these experiments are dead ends; but they invariably
provide me with more information about how to solve the kind of problem I&#39;m
working in.</p>

<p>Safety to experiment is crucial for building judgement.</p>

<h3 id="surround-yourself-with-expertise">Surround Yourself With Expertise</h3>

<p>While I may think I&#39;m pretty hot shit when it comes to software development, the
fact of the matter is that there are thousands of developers with more experience,
better judgement, and deeper understanding than I. Add in the sheer breadth of
specialities in software and it&#39;s pretty overwhelming. And humbling!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent the past 6 years building a network of people across a wide range of
specialities. From software testers to interaction designers to operations
engineers to machine learning scientists. When I have a problem, I can send off
an email or aks a question in IRC or Twitter.</p>

<p>By investing in friendships across disciplines I &quot;outsource&quot; my judgement. This
helps me build judgement in a new territory quickly and effectively.</p>

<h3 id="read-constantly">Read. Constantly.</h3>

<p>And not just books. Read code. Find small code bases that do specific things and
read and annotate them. Find large code bases and skim them. I regularly
practice diving into an unfamiliar project and figuring out what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>This builds judgement by letting me see how people I&#39;ve never even met solve
problems. It also builds my ability to understand unfamiliar code.</p>

<p>Not to undervalue books at all. I easily spend $500+ a year in technology books;
mostly when I&#39;m learning a framework, language or tool.</p>

<h3 id="turn-the-knob-to-11">Turn The Knob To 11</h3>

<p>Turning the knob to 11 is when you take a very specific concept; and over-apply
it. Over-applying a technique or technology is the easiest way to find its
shortcomings. Want to learn to TDD? TDD <em>everything</em> for a year. At the end
you&#39;ll have a solid understanding of when to and when not to TDD.</p>

<p>I love turning the knob to 11; but since it is directly intended to discover
where something breaks down it isn&#39;t always a good practice to apply to
production code.</p>

<h3 id="judgement-makes-perfect">Judgement Makes Perfect</h3>

<p>Practice makes permanent, feedback and judgement makes perfect. Reflect on
your work. Intentionally seek the edges of your skills. This is how you move
beyond junior.</p>

      <h2>Build a Command Line Remote Pairing Setup</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>Over the past couple years I&#39;ve done a bit of remote pairing. When I need a GUI
everything is pretty straightforward: <a href="http://join.me">Join.me</a> for
screen/keyboard sharing and iPad with Skype or Google Hangout for video calls.
This is pretty bandwidth intensive and can be slow, so I&#39;d rather keep as much
as I can in a terminal.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a few obstacles to that though:</p>

<ul>
<li> I travel a lot, so my network location is random and I can&#39;t change the
coffee shops firewall</li>
<li> I want to see anything my partner do</li>
<li> I want to add partners easily</li>
<li> I don&#39;t want to share any passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thankfully a remote virtual machine, SSH, and tmux let me meet all these
requirements. Hooray!</p>

<h2 id="set-up-the-remote-server">Set up the remote server</h2>

<p>I use <a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr.com</a> for my utility server provider.
They&#39;ve got great support, don&#39;t overload their servers, and they love their
customers. This is a pretty low intensity server, so a 128MB instance is
probably fine.</p>

<p>Add two user accounts. One is for you to log in to and manage the server. Don&#39;t
even think about using root! The other is for your partners to log in with. I
use the name <code>pair</code> for mine.</p>

<p>For some distributions of *nix you&#39;ll need to allow port forwarding over SSH.
To do this open up the servers sshd_config as root (typically located at
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>), find or add the  <code>AllowTcpForwarding</code> line, set it to
<code>yes</code>, and ensure it&#39;s uncommented.</p>

<h3 id="configure-your-user">Configure your user</h3>

<p>Your user&#39;s role on this server is to allow you to use SSH to forward a port on
the server to your system. To be honest, you don&#39;t need to change anything, but
I recommend using keys to access your server instead of a password. To do that,
you&#39;ll need to create an <code>authorized_keys</code> file in your <code>~/.ssh</code> directory.
This file must <em>be only accessible to your user</em> otherwise it will not be
accepted by any sane distributions ssh server. To make it yours and yours
alone, type <code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> before going forward.</p>

<p>Now, append your public key to the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file. Github
provides an <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">excellent tutorial on creating ssh
keys</a> if you don&#39;t think
you have a public key.</p>

<p>From now on, typing <code>ssh your-user@your-server</code> will use key-pair
encryption to verify your identity; which is far more secure than meager
passwords. For an added security boost you may want to edit your
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and change <code>PasswordAuthentication</code> to <code>no</code> <em>after
you&#39;ve verified logging in without a password works.</em></p>

<h3 id="configure-the-pair-user">Configure the pair user</h3>

<p>The pair user is where the magic happens. Login to the pair user, and create an
authorized keys file by typing <code>touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and change it&#39;s
permissions <code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>!</p>

<h4 id="adding-a-partners-public-key">Adding a partners public key</h4>

<p>When we append a partners public key to the authorized_keys file we want to
prefix it with the <code>command</code> ssh directive:</p>

<p><code>command=&quot;ssh &lt;my-user-name&gt;@localhost -p 1337&quot;,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding &lt;my-partners-public-key&gt;</code></p>

<p>This forces the incoming connection to execute an ssh command to connect to
localhost on port 1337, and once that is complete it will kill the connection.
The <code>no-(agent|port|X11)-forwarding</code> directives are another security
precaution. Now we can add anyone we want as a partner with very little fear.</p>

<p>Go ahead and add your public key as a partner for now, then from your local
machine type <code>ssh pair@your-server</code>. This should give you a message like
<code>ssh: connect to host localhost port 1337: Connection refused</code></p>

<p>This is good! It means that you successfully connected as <code>pair</code> on your server
<em>and</em> it tried to connect to ssh on port 1337! Yay!</p>

<p>All that&#39;s left to do now is to generate an ssh key for the pair user, so log
back in to the server as <code>pair</code> and follow step 3 on the aforementioned <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">ssh
key tutorial</a>. This is
the key we&#39;ll give access rights to our machine; using the <code>command</code> directive
to always force them into joining an existing tmux session.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-machine">Set up your machine</h2>

<h3 id="install-tmux">Install tmux</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re on a Mac I recommend installing tmux through
<a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew</a>. Most Linux distributions come
with it as a package in their standard repository now a days.</p>

<h3 id="set-up-your-local-ssh-server-and-authorized_keys">Set up your local ssh server and authorized_keys</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re on a mac, you&#39;ll need to <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/30/remote-login-ssh-server-mac-os-x/">enable remote
login</a>. If
you&#39;re a Linux person make sure you have the sshd package installed and the
service running.</p>

<p>Once that&#39;s done, set up your authorized_keys for your local machine: <code>touch
~/.ssh/authorized_keys &amp;&amp; chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></p>

<p>Now take the public key you created for the pair username, and add it to the
end of your <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file, like so:</p>

<p><code>command=&quot;tmux attach&quot;,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding &lt;pair-users-ssh-public-key&gt;</code></p>

<h3 id="test-it-out">Test it out</h3>

<p>From your local machine open a new terminal and type <code>ssh -R1337:localhost:22
your-user@your-server</code> . This sets up the network forwarding stuff. Yay!</p>

<p>From a second terminal, type in <code>ssh pair@your-server</code>. This should give you
at least these two lines:  <code>no sessions</code> and <code>Connection to localhost closed</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>no sessions</code> line is letting us know tmux doesn&#39;t have anything to attach
to. the <code>Connection to localhost closed</code> is letting us know that we were kicked
off the system. As we should be!</p>

<p>Now, on <em>another</em> terminal launch <code>tmux</code>, then from the second terminal try
<code>ssh pair@your-server</code> again. If all goes well, you should see the contents
of the third terminal in the second terminal, and it should redraw pretty fast.</p>

<h3 id="further-enhancements">Further enhancements</h3>

<p>This is my vanilla command line remote pairing environment. If you want more
power, there&#39;s a few things you should do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux">tmux book</a></li>
<li>Enhance tmux with <a href="https://github.com/zolrath/wemux">wemux</a> or <a href="https://github.com/benmills/vimux">vimux</a></li>
<li>Look into <a href="http://mosh.mit.edu/">mosh</a> as an ssh alternative. It&#39;s supposed to be great for low-bandwidth situations.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Ignorance and Realism in Testing</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>I was talking through some of my thoughts on applying visual and interaction
design critique principles to code with <a href="http://www.ecomba.org/">Enrique Comba</a>.
At the time, I was in the middle of analyzing the differences between <a href="https://gist.github.com/4141476#file_normal_spec.rb">directly
calling the method</a> under
test, <a href="https://gist.github.com/4141476#file_let_spec.rb">nested describes and
lets</a>, and using a <a href="https://gist.github.com/4141476#file_custom_assertion_spec.rb">custom
assertion</a>.</p>

<p>I was pointing out how moving the method call out to a custom assert hid a
breadcrumb developers would use when understanding the system under test, while
leaving it in a let would at least keep it in the same test file. Enrique
responded with an interesting perspective:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;That&#39;s the point of BDD. Your tests shouldn&#39;t care about your implementation
at all.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I was a little taken aback. One of my favorite parts about clearly written specs
is how they give the programmer direction in the use of the code being tested.
If the test code is completely ignorant of the implementation, how can it
provide those insights?!</p>

<p>After an hour or so, I started thinking about <a href="http://about.me/searls">Justin
Searls</a> recent presentation on <a href="http://oredev.org/2012/sessions/budgeting-reality-a-new-approach-to-mock-objects">realism in
tests</a>.
This got me thinking: <strong>What if the level of realism and the level of ignorance
of a test are two related variables?</strong> A test which provides a high level of
realism of the system under test may not mock out external services the system
uses because it does not know about them. Conversely, tests which provides a low
level of realism often very clearly point out how its collaborators must be
formed, as well as the usage of the code under test.</p>

<p>Hopefully these complementary insights will provide me with more purposeful,
better organized test suites in the future.</p>

<p>We coders have all kinds of definitions of simple code. To some, simple code is
code they understand and read easily. Others believe simple code follows the
coolest, most appropriate design pattern. Some say simple code has the fewest
characters.</p>

<p>Extreme Programming tries to setttle that debate by offering <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html">four qualities of
simple code</a>: testability,
browsability, understandability, and explainabilty.</p>

<p>To make these qualities easier to remember I coin the mnemonic TUBE.</p>

<h3 id="testable">Testable</h3>

<p>Can automated tests be written for each piece of functionality and permutation
of behavior? Are there positive <em>and</em> negative use-cases?</p>

<h3 id="understandable">Understandable</h3>

<p>When you read a function, does it do what you expected given it&#39;s method
signature? How long does it take to figure out what the code does?</p>

<h3 id="browsable">Browsable</h3>

<p>Can the code be browsed in an IDE? How quickly does someone who didn&#39;t write the
code find what they&#39;re looking for?</p>

<h3 id="explainable">Explainable</h3>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure this is here twice because it&#39;s so important. Can a different
developer tell you what the code does? Does their explanation match yours?</p>

<p>If your code meets these criteria, congratulations! Your code fits in the TUBE,
and when the TUBE fits, make commits!</p>
