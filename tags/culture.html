      <h2>Defining My Dream Job</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>About a year ago I got back into freelancing and started building a small,
distributed development studio. While I enjoyed the freedom and the people; I
couldn&#39;t sustain the constant sales cycle and discovered management and
operations is a recipe for burnout for me. My constant anxiety over payroll,
bookkeeping and cash flow was/is debilitating.</p>

<p>I could write in depth about what I&#39;ve learned about myself and running a
business over the past year; or describe the agony of laying off good people who
may struggle to find new work due to systemic bias; or tipping into depression
due to a combination of burnout and the erosion of my self-confidence. But
instead I&#39;d like to look forward. It&#39;s less painful.</p>

<p>It is time to shut down the consultancy side of Zinc. Zinc will remain focused
on <a href="https://apprenticeship.community">The Apprenticeship Community</a> and <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/justenoughmedia">Just
Enough Media</a>. We&#39;ve ramped down our
delivery team, and while most have found new homes already; if you&#39;re a
pairing company looking for junior and/or senior Javascript / Ruby developers
<a href="mailto:zee@wecohere.com">ping me</a>.</p>

<p>This also means I am officially looking for full or part-time work; and do not
intend to continue consulting (at least, not primarily as a deliverer of
software).</p>

<p>What would hiring me do for your team? My entire career has been built by
combining a reasonable level of proficiency at shipping working software with
the ability to to create opportunity for those around me to improve their
skills.</p>

<p>My undying passion is helping teams and people become more effective. While I love
working closely with a team of compassionate, curious, cross-skilled peers
building solid software that meets customers needs and has a high degree of
technical quality; my greatest love is helping people plan, execute, and
reflect on their professional growth.</p>

<p>My ideal job consists of working with varied teams that recognize the
value of people of different backgrounds, skill levels, and perspectives. The
antithesis of the ego driven, senior obsessed, &quot;We hire the best&quot;
<a href="http://carlos.bueno.org/2014/06/mirrortocracy.html">mirrortocracy</a>.</p>

<p>I want to focus on guiding and facilitating peer mentorship and intentional
professional growth. I disagree completely with the notion that professional
growth &quot;happens naturally.&quot; It takes intentional investment in time and money.
It requires recognition that social and personal structures are a critical part
of a learning culture.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say I won&#39;t be coding. Collaborating on projects is required to
understand someone and assist them in planning their growth. I want
contributions to be evaluated not by features shipped or tasks completed but by
my fellow-workers ability to plan, observe and measure their professional
growth.</p>

<p>If I were to write my own job description, it would look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organizes and facilitates retrospectives, open-spaces, and other
peer-learning activities.</li>
<li><a href="http://mobprogramming.org">Mob programs</a> with teams and pair programs with
individuals with an emphasis on gleaning understanding and reflection while
doing work.</li>
<li>Facilitates one-on-one and/or small group learning planning and reflection.</li>
<li>Ships software as part of a set of teams, with an emphasis on
cross-pollination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, I&#39;d be happy to work with a company that can demonstrate that
these responsibilities are taken care of already.</p>

<p>I can subsist as an independent freelancer indefinitely; and will continue to
do so until I find the right place. How would I describe this place?</p>

<ol>
<li>It recognizes the insidious, destructive nature of micro-aggressions and
subtle *isms and considers compassion a core skill.</li>
<li>It has inoculated itself against &quot;senior-coder-itis&quot; and actively hires
across skill levels and specializations; while paying equitable salaries.</li>
<li>It prioritizes perks such as 401(k)s, trans-inclusive health care, and
sustainable pace over ping pong tables and free beer.</li>
<li>It is based somewhere with good mass transit; or allows remote work. I&#39;m
currently based out of Oakland, California and am highly interested in
Montreal, Quebec.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are interested, I&#39;d love to <a href="mailto:zee@wecohere.com">get in touch</a>.
If you&#39;re not, I&#39;d appreciate <a href="https://twitter.com/zspencer/status/628566493748289536">a signal boost on social
media</a>.</p>

      <h2>Effective Code Critique</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>Code review gets a bad rap. People worry that code reviews slow teams down,
create conflict between team members, or disempower team members by taking away
decision making authority.</p>

<p>I believe these concers are anti-patterns that indicate a team is using code
review for <em>criticism</em> as opposed to <em>critique</em>. What&#39;s the difference?
<em>Critique is focused on  specific parameters, where criticism is unbound.</em></p>

<p>That said, many programmers are unclear how to perform judgement free code
reviews. The following are a series of suggestions which may help move code
reviews from criticism to critique:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#start-with-compassion">Start with compassion</a></li>
<li><a href="#working-code-wins">Working code wins</a></li>
<li><a href="#discuss-clarity,-coupling,-cohesion,-and-encapsulation">Discuss clarity, coupling, cohesion, and encapsulation</a></li>
<li><a href="#celebrate-intentionally">Celebrate intentionally</a></li>
<li><a href="#follow-up">Follow up</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="start-with-compassion">Start With Compassion</h2>

<p>I like to begin each review by reflecting on the context of the person
submitting the code. Are they experienced team members or novices? Do you have
good rapport with them? Are they under schedule or personal or professional
pressure?</p>

<p>I follow that up by reminding myself of a variation on the retrospective prime
directive; the submitter is doing the best they can given their past experiences
and current context. This isn&#39;t to say the work is above reproach; but that the
submitter is doing the best they can.</p>

<h2 id="working-code-wins">Working Code Wins</h2>

<p>Code review may be used as a gate to prevent technically concerning code from
entering the system. This is a flawed approach to code review as it introduces
an unpredictable amount of latency in a workflow and implies distrust. I prefer
to allow anyone to merge the code right away, so long as the merger has
confidence that the change causes benefits from the user or business
perspective. I ask myself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I understand the goals of the change?</li>
<li>Does it meet my understanding of user or business needs?</li>
<li>What are the changes potential unintended side effects?</li>
<li>Does the change update the user facing documentation?</li>
<li>Do tests demonstrate the features functionality? These don&#39;t need to go
through the UI, especialls when there&#39;s reasonable confidence in the code
connecting the interface to the feature.</li>
<li>Is there an image, gif, or video demonstrating the feature in use attached
to the change? This makes it much easier for team members to evaluate the
change from a users perspective.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the code can be said to be working; then it may be merged ASAP. Further code
review for a piece of work may continue <em>past</em> the change being released into
production.</p>

<p>Allowing anyone to carry forward or merge a change at any time encourages low
cycle times, high flow, and tight collaboration between team members.</p>

<h2 id="discuss-clarity-coupling-cohesion-and-encapsulation">Discuss Clarity, Coupling, Cohesion, and Encapsulation</h2>

<p>Code reviews often focus on style over substance. I prefer to use linters or
automated style checkers in the build to pre-empt stylistic comments. This frees
up team members to focus on how a change impacts maintainability of the sofware.
The four aspects I focus on are clarity, coupling, cohesion, and encapsulation.</p>

<h3 id="clarity-what-does-this-code-mean">Clarity - What Does This Code Mean?</h3>

<p>Clarity is all about names, documentation, tests, types, etc. Clear code helps
future maintainers to understand the intent of the code as well as the
implementation. Are commit messages and notes coherent? Are the names of
variables and methods reasonable? Are there usage examples? Are types or shapes
of data demonstrated or enforced?</p>

<p>Unclear code indicates a change lacks cohesion, has unnecessary coupling, or
poorly encapsulates the goal of the change. By paying attention to the clarity,
we make it easier to pick up the code and make changes later on.</p>

<h3 id="coupling-what-does-this-code-work-with">Coupling - What Does This Code Work With?</h3>

<p>Coupling is when changes to other components may require changes in this section
of code. How many external collaborators are used to do the work?  How deeply
does this code reach into it&#39;s collaborators? How many of their functions are
being used? In cases where coupling with external collaborators is both wide and
deep it can be valuable to write an intermediary to wrap the collaborators and
expose a smaller surface area to the new code.</p>

<p>By drawing attention to coupling, we may reduce the likelihood that we&#39;ll have
to change this code when another component changes.</p>

<h3 id="encapsulation-how-will-others-use-this-code">Encapsulation - How Will Others Use This Code?</h3>

<p>While coupling is how a component interacts with outside collaborators;
encapsulation is how outside consumers interact with a given component. One
indicator of a loosely encapsulated component is difficulty in testing. A
component that is hard to test is difficult to use. This is likely because the
the code unintentionally exposes it&#39;s implementation. Sometimes the difficulty
in testing is hidden behind test helpers; where a more effective approach may be
to improve the interface of the component itself.</p>

<p>Long argument lists, callbacks, option hashes with required keys, and parameter
objects are all indicators of loose encapsulation. In many cases these are
completely reasonable; after all reducing the surface area of an interface
likely diminishes it&#39;s utility. In other cases, it&#39;s a sign the component may
be doing too much.</p>

<p>When we draw attention to codes encapsulation during review, it creates an
opportunity to simplify interfaces and decrease the cost of re-using the
component.</p>

<h3 id="cohesion-what-is-the-codes-job">Cohesion - What Is The Codes Job?</h3>

<p>The clearest example of non-cohesive code is a horror story from my youth.
There was a SQL query which had hardcoded values it would return in order to
change the color of a label. The argument could be made that this encapsulated
the behavior of the feature; but in doing so it mixed the responsibility of
retrieving data with the responsibility of presenting the data. Cohesive code
eschews additional responsibilities wherever it can; resulting in horizontal
layers and vertical slices.</p>

<p>By drawing attention to the cohesion of code we create opportunities to improve
clarity by grouping related functionality and un-grouping un-related
functionality. This un-related functionality may become either a collaborator or a
consumer of the component it was extracted from.</p>

<p>When we frame our code review in terms of clarity, coupling, encapsulation, and
cohesion we change the focus from the programmer and place it squarely on the
artifact. It also moves us out of the world of moral judgement such as what&#39;s
the &quot;best&quot; way to do something and into a conversation about the
tradeoffs that we make as we build a software system together.</p>

<h2 id="celebrate-intentionally">Celebrate Intentionally</h2>

<p>Despite our best intentions; no matter how well a code review goes it is still
a high pressure situation for the submitter. No matter how I try, I still feel
a bit sad when someone critiques my code. To counter the inevitable bummer of
critical feedback I try to comment on parts of the code that are of high quality
or teach me something. It can also help to use celebratory emoji.</p>

<p>The important part is to always be genuine in your celebration; as it is often
impossible to discern between sarcasm or mockery and genuine excitement or
positivity. Especially for people who struggle to value their own contributions
already.</p>

<h2 id="follow-up">Follow Up</h2>

<p>If there&#39;s valuable changes to be made from code review but the work was merged
already; it&#39;s OK to add the desired changes in your task or project tracking
system. I generally prefer that the team has sole discretion on when to
complete those tasks; as they&#39;ll have a better understanding of the cost of
delaying clean up as well as the impact that maintainability improvements will
have on short and long term goals.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, I believe a compassionate, critique-oriented code review practice
results in high quality code and allows companies to include team members who
struggle with pair or mob programming.</p>

      <h2>Effectively Onboarding Junior Team Members</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>It&#39;s no secret there is a growing demand for technical and creative skills and
that our educational system is struggling to provide the skills to deliver
useful, working, modern products and services. This is further exacerbated by
our industries <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/manufacturing-the-talent-shortage">unwillingness to look beyond a certain
archetype</a>.</p>

<p>Companies are now realizing what science has told us for years: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task#Explanations_of_performance_on_the_task">framing the
problem effectively is the best way to encourage others to solve
it</a>
and are responding by investing more heavily in employee training. Companies
such as
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/facebook-engineering-bootcamp/177577963919">Facebook</a>,
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/courses/agile-object-oriented-boot-camp">Thoughtworks</a>,
and <a href="https://www.devmynd.com/jobs/apprenticeship">so</a>,
<a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/2012/software-apprenticeship/groupons-apprenticeship-program/">so</a>,
<a href="http://www.detroitlabs.com/apprentice/">many</a>,
<a href="http://www.8thlight.com/apprenticeship">more</a> are turning to the
retro-education (Retrocation?) technique of apprenticeship to train technical
team members.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship programs encourage learning on the job by creating social and
structural norms where it is safe to not know, to be wrong, and to make
mistakes. Even well structured apprenticeship programs may cause
<a href="/migitating-anxiety-on-software-teams/">anxiety</a> which adds to a junior team
member&#39;s cognitive overhead and shrink their learning capacity.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that the companies where junior team members are most successful share
common attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frequent, high quality feedback.</li>
<li>Tight integration on a team that does useful, valuable work.</li>
<li>Budgets for continued education and training.</li>
<li>Regular, intentional interactions with senior and executive level colleagues.</li>
<li>Dedicated advocates for team members.</li>
<li>Flexible organizational architecture.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frequent-high-quality-feedback">Frequent, High Quality Feedback</h3>

<p>Delivering specific, actionable and kind feedback is <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/presentations/the-most-valuable-skill">the most valuable
skill</a> you can
build on your team. Without frequent, compassionate feedback small behavioral
concerns or technical misunderstandings become educational blockers. Just as the
cost to fix a bug increases the longer the fix is delayed, innacurate mental
models or behavioral patterns calcify into habits that take much more work to
rectify.</p>

<p>I recommend a four-pronged approach to delivering feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frequent <a href="#pairing">pairing</a> or <a href="#mobbing">mobbing</a> on a feature or task.</li>
<li>Integrated critical peer reviews of work output.</li>
<li>1 on 1 meetings between team members and their advocate.</li>
<li>Regular full team retrospectives.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pairing-and-mobbing">Pairing and Mobbing</h4>

<p>Pairing and mobbing provide real-time opportunities to refine mental models and
behaviors. A solid, real-time collaborative working relationship is the best
learning tool ever.</p>

<p>Pairing is when two people on the same computer, drawing pad, or other creative
tool working on the same task. Pairing is a powerful tool for building a shared
understanding of technique, principles, and practices; as it allows ideas to
emerge which combine the best of both participants.</p>

<p><a href="http://mobprogramming.org">Mobbing</a> is similar to <a href="#pairing">pairing</a>, with the
added bonus of having even more context and understanding around the task.</p>

<p>Pairing and mobbing is especially helpful for junior team members as they are
given an opportunity to do real, useful, valuable work in an environment where
any grievous errors can be corrected immediately and new techniques, principles
and patterns can be introduced at the exact time they&#39;re most useful.</p>

<h4 id="regular-critical-peer-reviews">Regular, critical peer reviews</h4>

<p>Building peer review into your work process creates an opportunity for
observing and re-aligning low-level concerns (&quot;It looks like you&#39;re using a shade
of blue that&#39;s different than our style guide, why is that?&quot;) as well as
high-level concerns (&quot;This part of our application seems to be collecting long
methods which take many arguments. How could we refactor it to encourage
smaller, composable parts?&quot;).</p>

<p>These reviews are best when they&#39;re independently useful pieces of work being
compared against the artifact without the work. For those using version control,
this review happens for every <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html">submitted
patch</a>.</p>

<p><em>Reviews should never, ever block useful work being completed.</em> If the work
passes a very minimum level of quality (tests pass, adheres to style guide) then
it should be merged as soon as the path submitter it. This provides junior
contributors with confidence that their work is useful and meaningful while
still creating opportunities for learning via critical, specific, kind feedback
and ensuring a minimum level of quality of the work.</p>

<h4 id="1-on-1s-between-a-team-member-and-an-advocate">1 on 1s Between a Team Member and an Advocate</h4>

<p>As humans, we thrive on appreciation and connection. The surest sign you
appreciate someone is to support them in places that person lacks influence.</p>

<p>An advocate&#39;s role is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Listen to and understand a team member and their emotional and intellectual
connection to their day to day work.</li>
<li>Encourage and refine suggestions for how the company can change to support the
team member.</li>
<li>Introduce, promote and advocate those changes in circles outside of the team
members influence.</li>
<li>Relay back realistic progress on the changes a team member is asking for.</li>
</ul>

<p>Listening to and understanding a single team member at a time allows concerns to
surface that may be difficult or uncomfortable to discuss in team
retrospectives. By making 1 on 1s regular we create space for people who are
ignored in rough-and-tumble loudest-person-wins tech culture.</p>

<p>Because tech companies frequently over-value expertise and experience, junior
team members relevant, valuable insights into a culture can be ignored and
marginalized without dedicated space.</p>

<p>If your culture is especially rough and tumble, you may consider ensuring
advocates do not work directly with the team member they advocate for, as the
day-to-day baggage can be carried into these conversations.</p>

<h4 id="regular-full-team-retrospectives">Regular Full Team Retrospectives</h4>

<p>Retrospectives are where a group gets together, reflects on the past month or
so, and discusses what they want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep doing</li>
<li>Start doing</li>
<li>Do more of</li>
<li>Stop doing</li>
<li>Do less of</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649">forms a retrospective can
take</a>,
but these 5 items are the main gist. </p>

<p>Good retrospectives start with the <a href="http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html">retrospective prime
directive</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of what we discover, <em>we understand and truly believe that
everyone did the best job they could</em>, given what they knew at the time,
their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation
at hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Retrospectives, when time is allocated to address the issues brought up, can go
a long way towards creating a cohesive, functional, productive team. They are
especially useful for junior team members as good retrosepctives model a
productive, tension-resolving discussion; a skill that will serve them well
throughout their career and help them become the kind of team members that
proactively solve problems.</p>

<p>Retrospectives are not a cure all. In situations where trust is broken a
retrospective can cause more harm than good. <em>If any person cannot in good
conscience agree to the retrospective prime directive, that must be respected.</em></p>

<p>In those cases, it is best for a conflict resolution specialist to investigate
potential bad actors, remove them if found, and rebuild trust.</p>

<h3 id="tight-integration-on-a-team-that-does-useful-valuable-work">Tight Integration on a Team that Does Useful, Valuable Work</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a minor anti-pattern where interns or junior team members are tossed
onto an unimportant side-project that doesn&#39;t matter if it lives or dies. While
I strongly advocate for <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys">breakable
toys</a>
there&#39;s no stronger signal that you don&#39;t trust or believe in someone than to
give them work that doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Of course, putting someone with little experience or judgement on a critical
project is also risky. We mitigate this risk by integrating junior team member
into teams where <a href="#frequent-high-quality-feedback">frequent, high quality
feedback</a> is the status quo.</p>

<p>If none of your teams have a culture of compassionate feedback, find the one
that is most open or closest to the principles and focus on improving their
feedback skills over a few months before bringing on a junior team member. While
it can seem incredibly mechanistic, even highly experienced people can benefit
from specific, actionable and kind feedback.</p>

<h3 id="continued-education-and-training-budgets">Continued Education and Training Budgets</h3>

<p>When I was considering changing jobs from my first full time position I was
chatting with <a href="http://xndev.com">Matt Heusser</a> about compensation and he said
something that stuck with me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Money is the secular form of value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On it&#39;s face this looks obvious, yet it has powerful implications.  If a
company claims to value education or learning, it must also <em>spend money</em> on
learning and education.</p>

<p>If you plan to hire junior team members, provide them a dedicated budget to
improve their skills. Make it high enough to cover a dozen books, online
training courses, conferences (including travel and meals), and perhaps even
professional 1 on 1 training.</p>

<p>Make sure they understand that the budget is <em>for them</em>. They get to choose the
things that work best for their education and their interests. Make sure they
spend it. Training is an investment that pays off over months and years, but
money and time not spent learning can never be re-claimed.</p>

<p>Junior team members especially benefit from this because they have so much to
learn and absorb. There is so much upside potential it doesn&#39;t make sense to
pinch pennies here.</p>

<h3 id="regular-intentional-senior-and-executive-interactions">Regular, Intentional Senior and Executive Interactions</h3>

<p>At even small to medium sized companies, there can be an interaction gap between
the most junior and the most senior or executive colleagues. A companies
leadership sets values and principles that people throughout the company ascribe
to. Junior team members are often left out of the interactions that create and
share these principles and values; leaving them wondering what they&#39;re supposed
to do or what is even important.</p>

<p>By creating a collaborative culture between junior team members and senior team
members and executives we combine the freshest perspective with the strongest
judgement and the clearest, most bought-into vision. This is where the magic
happens.</p>

<h3 id="dedicated-advocates-for-team-members">Dedicated Advocates for Team Members</h3>

<p>As <a href="#on-1s-between-a-team-member-and-an-advocate">mentioned previously</a>,
advocacy for team members outside of their sphere of influence is important.
While the best managers and leaders do this already, formalizing it into the job
descriptions of your company engraines advocacy as valued, desired behavior.</p>

<h3 id="flexible-organizational-structure">Flexible Organizational Structure</h3>

<p>When bringing on team members without much experience it&#39;s possible the team
they&#39;re on or the role they&#39;re brought in for is not actually a good match. A
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Corporate-Lattice-Achieving-Performance/dp/1422155161">flexible
organization</a>
allows people to find where their existing and desired skills fit well with the
companies needs. Flexible organizations create opportunities for people to
transition across roles and teams as they develop skills and improve their
careers.</p>

<p>When a company over-values a specific set of skills and under-values others, it
disincentivizes people from doing the work they&#39;re best at in favor of the work
they are rewarded more for. Flexible organizations pay everyone well and
recognize the value of all the skills necessary to create, deliver and support
the organization.</p>

      <h2>Migitating Anxiety On Software Teams</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>Software development is a creative pursuit. It takes intense focus as well as
time away from a problem to for subconscious work. Both of these cognitive modes
are debilitated by stress and anxiety.</p>

<p>A major source of anxiety is uncertainty. Uncertainty is almost always deeply
personal, and may be about many things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are we earning enough to live comfortably?</li>
<li>Are we compensated fairly for our time, effort and skills?</li>
<li>Are our skills improving in a worth-while direction at a reasonable rate?</li>
<li>Are we learning what we want to learn?</li>
<li>Am we at risk of <a href="http://www.apa.org/research/action/stereotype.aspx">stereotype
threat</a>?</li>
<li>Is our work of a good quality?</li>
<li>How do others perceive us? (especially those we respect or in positions of authority.)</li>
<li>Is our work environment comfortable and condusive to our work style?</li>
<li>Does our work matter?</li>
<li>Do people expect us to represent <a href="http://xkcd.com/385">other people like us</a>?</li>
<li>And many, many more.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may map these reasons to <a href="http://danpink.com">dan pink&#39;s</a> three drivers for
motivation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mastery</li>
<li>Autonomy</li>
<li>Purpose</li>
</ul>

<p>Anxiety saps our motivation by discouraging or obscuring mastery, making us
subservient to our fears, and keeps us focused inward instead of on the effect
of the work we&#39;re doing. When we are anxious our conscious and sub-concious
attention is drained, preventing us from executing.</p>

<p>In a well-adjusted team, we must make an effort to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand the anxieties we face individually and as a group.</li>
<li>Take concrete steps to address and alleviate anxieties.</li>
<li>Advocate for and make systemic changes which mitigate these anxieties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our responses to how anxiety manifests are often personal. There&#39;s no &quot;one size
fits all&quot; approach to ensure people maintain a state of productive flow
unhindered by uncertainty and anxiety; however there are some things that have
significant impact:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compensation</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Information</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compensation">Compensation</h3>

<p>Anxieties rooted in finances are sticky. People feel uncomfortable discussing
money and companies prefer to keep personnel costs low. This is especially true
in software companies which have most of their budget devoted to salaries and
benefits.</p>

<p>Some companies are taking radical steps, such as <a href="http://www.management30.com/workout/salary-formula/">using a salary
formula</a> and <a href="https://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/">publicly
publishing salary
data</a>.
I&#39;m not 100% sold on this level of transparency, but it is a powerful way to
address perceived fairness. Here are a few other steps to reduce anxiety and
maintain high levels of creativity, attention, and motivation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pay people well and fairly, regardless of role. Pay hierarchies cause people
to resent others in roles at different pay levels, especially when there&#39;s not
many opportunities to understand and appreciate the work others are doing.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t trade &quot;culture&quot; for compensation. Office toys and work-cations are
fun, but it doesn&#39;t put food on the table; and they <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/how-perks-can-divide-us">can cause unintended
division</a>. Perks
can&#39;t take priority over respect.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t over-sell equity. Future income doesn&#39;t alleviate current financial
pressure. A high-value on equity may encourage distrust, since the founders,
executives or board members &quot;selling&quot; the equity tend to over-value it. Plus,
startup equity <a href="http://danilocampos.com/2015/01/startup-equity-benefits-your-boss-not-you/">disproportionaly benefits
owners</a>
over employees.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p>Many software professionals are driven by our ability to create. We want to see
our abilities deepen and learn complementary skills. At the same time, we fear
our work is sub-par or we <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/morty-lefkoe/do-you-suffer-from-the-im_b_4791763.html">don&#39;t
belong</a>.</p>

<p>While we can&#39;t guarantee the language or framework we&#39;re using will continue to
be in fashion, we can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a set of expectations about what skills are valued in a given role. By
explicitely defining what makes a &quot;Senior&quot; engineer vs. a &quot;Junior&quot; one, we
create a mirror for people to look into and self-evaluate that the skills they
have are valuable.</li>
<li>Focus on fundamentals and core skills instead of frameworks and technologies.
New techniques, libraries, and concepts come and go in the software world. By
encouraging people to level up their core skills we create current and future safety.</li>
<li>Support new ideas and techniques. Discouraging teammates from trying out a new
technology or user research technique is an easy way to cause self-doubt and
anxiety.</li>
<li>Support learning. Encourage reading at work. Provide a budget for
self-improvement that doesn&#39;t have to be spent on conferences.  Support people
in the things and ways <em>they</em> want to learn, not just what a company deems
worthwhile.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="information">Information</h3>

<p>Layoffs and re-organizations are almost always a source of anxiety. Buffer has a
very interesting approach of <a href="https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-november-update-2347000-run-rate-1189000-users/">publicizing their financial data every
month</a>.
While, again, this may not work for every business; providing reliable
information that builds trust among the people in the business is crucial. Some
anxiety inducing questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are our sales healthy?</li>
<li>Is there a connection between the work we&#39;re doing and customer
satisfaction/financial stability?</li>
<li>What are the risks people see and how are we avoiding them?</li>
<li>Are there up-coming organizational changes that may affect how I do my work?</li>
</ul>

<p>How each company addresses these kinds of questions is tough. No matter how you
choose to do so, there&#39;s a few tactics that are effective:</p>

<ul>
<li>Terseness is a virtue. Long meandering reports are more interesting for the
person doing the reporting than the people effected by it.</li>
<li>Make it consumable asyncronously. Being able to read and review information at
ones own convenience allows people to decide when and what to explore.</li>
<li>Consistency is huge. Consistency in both delivery and type of information
presented helps people notice trends.</li>
<li><em>Don&#39;t mandate it</em>. Not everyone wants all the information or even the same
information. Distributing knowledge via a mandatory meeting can cast people
