Becoming an excellent programmer is hard. It takes [deliberate
practice](http://expertenough.com/1423/deliberate-practice),
[mentorship](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch04.html#find_mentors),
and availability of [quality](http://teamtreehouse.com/home)
[resources](https://www.codeschool.com/).

It takes [thousands of hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book\)) to
become en expert in a field, and programming is no exception.

I want to help people get their 10,000 hours. So I'm relaunching [Growing
Developers](http://growingdevelopers.com).

Growing Developers will offer discussion groups, chat rooms, hangouts, and other
pieces of [structure](/articles/structure-and-space/) to support an online
community of programmers who are constantly leveling up.

If you are interested in any way, drop me a line at
[hello@zeespencer.com](mailto:hello+gd@zeespencer.com) and we can level up
together.
