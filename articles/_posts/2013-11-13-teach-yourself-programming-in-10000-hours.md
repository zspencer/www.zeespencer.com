Becoming an excellent programmer is hard. It takes [deliberate
practice](http://expertenough.com/1423/deliberate-practice),
[mentorship](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch04.html#find_mentors),
and availability of [quality](http://teamtreehouse.com/home)
[resources](https://www.codeschool.com/).

But most of all, it takes time. Don't get me wrong, it's entirely possible to
become a competent beginner programmer after a [9 week
course](http://devbootcamp.com). These programs are the beginning of a
journey to becoming a competent programmer.

I'm here to offer my assistance to those who want to continue that journey.

What does this mean?

I'm relaunching [Growing Developers](http://growingdevelopers.com); not as a
video/hangout site; but as a community dedicated to helping programmers at any
stage of their journey become more excellent.

If you are interested in any way, drop me a line at
[hello@zeespencer.com](mailto:hello+gd@zeespencer.com) and we can level up
together.
