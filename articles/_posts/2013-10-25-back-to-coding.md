The last 9 months have been some of the most amazing, fullfilling, enjoyable
months I've ever had. I've been lucky enough to get to teach nearly 150 people
the basics of web development and help them begin a brand new career in a field
that I love.

This has consumed every spare ounce of energy available, so I'm looking forward
to taking time to relax and build some awesome software.

I'm looking for:

1. A distributed team I can work with
2. For 10~30 hours a week
3. To build something hard/fun/meaningful

If you are interested, I'd love to chat. My email is
