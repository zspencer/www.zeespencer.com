To ring in the new year, I want to expose some of my ignorance.

I'm a pretty sharp developer, I'm competent at experience and interaction design, and
I'm reasonably good at running a business. Yet I'm not even nearing an expert in
any of those things.

My strongest skills by far are in programming and my social circle attracts
fellow programmers. I love these people. They're smart, talented, have broad
sets of interests, and tongs of experience but they grow me more as a developer
or engineer than as a designer or a businessman.

Deepening my programming skills can make it difficult to relate with people
outside of that domain. I'm glad I chose to focus on programming
for the past few years, but I want to shore up the skills I've been
neglecting; which leads me to my question:

How do you find mentors outside of your core skill sets? How do you build
relationships with people who have passions orthogonal to yours?
