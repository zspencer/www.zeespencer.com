Last year was fantastic. I started my own business, helped three startups get
off the ground, learned a ton about working with distributed teams, and fell in
love.

This year is even more exciting! I just signed a 9 month contract with at
[DevBootCamp](http://devbootcamp) to teach for their San Francisco camp. I get
to teach hundreds of people as they begin their programming journey; talk about
fun!

While I was leary of boot-camp style developer training DevBootCamp won me over.
Not only are they teaching practical programming skills they're also teaching:

1. How to continue learning
2. How to solve problems
3. How to work as a team

DevBootCamp doesn't expect graduates to launch a startup or be a rails wizard at
the end of their program. They make three promises:

3. You'll know yourself enough to keep growing.
2. You'll learn enough code to [sweep the floor](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/career-development/9780596806842/accurate-self-assessment/sweep_the_floor).
1. You'll grow enough of a makers mindset to overcome software problems.

That's what makes a great beginner developer.

Not Rails. Not Node. Not Django. Not Spring.

Initiative, self-knowledge, humility, and enough experience to be useful.
