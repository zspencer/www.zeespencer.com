> First we shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us.

I first heard this phrase from my friend [Davin
Granroth](http://blog.davingranroth.com/). While it may have been meant
literally; I interpret it in a more allegorical fashion.

> First we shape our society, thereafter it shapes us.

Or (when we remove the linearity of it):

> As we shape our society, it also shapes us.

I propose the following two notions which shape society:

1. Space - The opportunities/lack of opportunities to exercise
   [agency](http://www.zeespencer.com/articles/agency-society-and-invention/).
2. Structure - The support for/obstacles to exercising your agency.

## Space

Space can be thought of as the availability of resources; such as time, money,
information, tools, mentorship, etc. For those who read Tom DeMarco it is
similar to his definition of
[slack](http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0932633617).

## Structure

Structure can be thought of as the rules, norms, physical constraints,
expectations, obligations, habits, or similar
[affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance).

## Conclusion

Space and structure are related. The only way to change space is to adjust
structure. Given the impact stuctural changes have, they should be intentional
and thoughtful.

Some questions to consider when changing structure:

1. What unintended obstacles may this change introduce?
2. What supports may be at risk from this change?
3. What lessons from applying this structure elsewhere may not apply here?
