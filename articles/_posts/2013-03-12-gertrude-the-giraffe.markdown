I have a small menagerie of pets I take with me wherever I go. One whose
accompanied me since I was a child is Gertrude the Giraffe. Gertrude has a
beautiful neck with spots which spell four words: _Guess, Google, Grab, Go_.

When I get stuck Gertrude reaches up with her long neck and plucks a leaf out of
a Guessandtrythis tree. She drops it in front of me and prods me until I pick it
up. With each guess I gather information to help us make another, better guess.

Gertrude is quite astute. If guessing isn't leading us anywhere, she nudges the
big red _Google It!_ button. We then guess how to get helpful information from
the Great Google.

If she senses Google doesn't have the wisdom we seek Gertrude will reach her
elegant neck out of my office, grab a colleague with her teeth, and drag them to
my desk. Once they get recover from their shock they provide all kinds of help
in solving my problem.

Gertrude is far more empathetic than I, and can sense when I'm too panicked to
move forward. She'll grab me from my chair and shove me out the door for a walk.
Each step takes me further and further from the problem at hand, until when I
finally make it back it is as if it's a brand new problem! The assumptions that
were clouding my view fall away and I see exactly how to move forward.

I'm glad Gertrude is there to remind me to guess, google, grab others, and go
for walks. I don't know where I'd be without her!
