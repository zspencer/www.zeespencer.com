title: How Do You Find Mentors Outside Your Core Skills?
tags: [published, questions, personal-development]

To ring in the new year, I want to expose some of my ignorance.

I'm a pretty sharp developer, I'm competent at experience and interaction design, and
I'm reasonably good at running a business. Yet I'm not even nearing an expert in
any of those things.

Because my strongest skills by far are in programming my social circle attracts
fellow programmers. I love these people. They're smart, they're talented, they
have broad sets of interests and experiences; but they grow me more as a
developer than as a designer or a businessman.

This is a double edged sword. While I consider myself personally successful,
deepening my programming skills can make it difficult to relate with people
outside of that domain. I'm very glad I made the choice to focus on programming
for the past few years, but I feel I need to shore up the skills I've been
neglecting; which leads me to my first question(s) of 2013:

How do you structure mentoring relationships? How do you find mentors outside of
your core skill sets? How do you build relationships with people who have
passions orthogonal to yours?
