      <h2>Effective Code Critique</h2>
    

  </header>
  <main id="content">
    <section id="article">
<p>Code review gets a bad rap. People worry that code reviews slow teams down,
create conflict between team members, or disempower team members by taking away
decision making authority.</p>

<p>I believe these concers are anti-patterns that indicate a team is using code
review for <em>criticism</em> as opposed to <em>critique</em>. What&#39;s the difference?
<em>Critique is focused on  specific parameters, where criticism is unbound.</em></p>

<p>That said, many programmers are unclear how to perform judgement free code
reviews. The following are a series of suggestions which may help move code
reviews from criticism to critique:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#start-with-compassion">Start with compassion</a></li>
<li><a href="#working-code-wins">Working code wins</a></li>
<li><a href="#discuss-clarity,-coupling,-cohesion,-and-encapsulation">Discuss clarity, coupling, cohesion, and encapsulation</a></li>
<li><a href="#celebrate-intentionally">Celebrate intentionally</a></li>
<li><a href="#follow-up">Follow up</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="start-with-compassion">Start With Compassion</h2>

<p>I like to begin each review by reflecting on the context of the person
submitting the code. Are they experienced team members or novices? Do you have
good rapport with them? Are they under schedule or personal or professional
pressure?</p>

<p>I follow that up by reminding myself of a variation on the retrospective prime
directive; the submitter is doing the best they can given their past experiences
and current context. This isn&#39;t to say the work is above reproach; but that the
submitter is doing the best they can.</p>

<h2 id="working-code-wins">Working Code Wins</h2>

<p>Code review may be used as a gate to prevent technically concerning code from
entering the system. This is a flawed approach to code review as it introduces
an unpredictable amount of latency in a workflow and implies distrust. I prefer
to allow anyone to merge the code right away, so long as the merger has
confidence that the change causes benefits from the user or business
perspective. I ask myself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I understand the goals of the change?</li>
<li>Does it meet my understanding of user or business needs?</li>
<li>What are the changes potential unintended side effects?</li>
<li>Does the change update the user facing documentation?</li>
<li>Do tests demonstrate the features functionality? These don&#39;t need to go
through the UI, especialls when there&#39;s reasonable confidence in the code
connecting the interface to the feature.</li>
<li>Is there an image, gif, or video demonstrating the feature in use attached
to the change? This makes it much easier for team members to evaluate the
change from a users perspective.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the code can be said to be working; then it may be merged ASAP. Further code
review for a piece of work may continue <em>past</em> the change being released into
production.</p>

<p>Allowing anyone to carry forward or merge a change at any time encourages low
cycle times, high flow, and tight collaboration between team members.</p>

<h2 id="discuss-clarity-coupling-cohesion-and-encapsulation">Discuss Clarity, Coupling, Cohesion, and Encapsulation</h2>

<p>Code reviews often focus on style over substance. I prefer to use linters or
automated style checkers in the build to pre-empt stylistic comments. This frees
up team members to focus on how a change impacts maintainability of the sofware.
The four aspects I focus on are clarity, coupling, cohesion, and encapsulation.</p>

<h3 id="clarity-what-does-this-code-mean">Clarity - What Does This Code Mean?</h3>

<p>Clarity is all about names, documentation, tests, types, etc. Clear code helps
future maintainers to understand the intent of the code as well as the
implementation. Are commit messages and notes coherent? Are the names of
variables and methods reasonable? Are there usage examples? Are types or shapes
of data demonstrated or enforced?</p>

<p>Unclear code indicates a change lacks cohesion, has unnecessary coupling, or
poorly encapsulates the goal of the change. By paying attention to the clarity,
we make it easier to pick up the code and make changes later on.</p>

<h3 id="coupling-what-does-this-code-work-with">Coupling - What Does This Code Work With?</h3>

<p>Coupling is when changes to other components may require changes in this section
of code. How many external collaborators are used to do the work?  How deeply
does this code reach into it&#39;s collaborators? How many of their functions are
being used? In cases where coupling with external collaborators is both wide and
deep it can be valuable to write an intermediary to wrap the collaborators and
expose a smaller surface area to the new code.</p>

<p>By drawing attention to coupling, we may reduce the likelihood that we&#39;ll have
to change this code when another component changes.</p>

<h3 id="encapsulation-how-will-others-use-this-code">Encapsulation - How Will Others Use This Code?</h3>

<p>While coupling is how a component interacts with outside collaborators;
encapsulation is how outside consumers interact with a given component. One
indicator of a loosely encapsulated component is difficulty in testing. A
component that is hard to test is difficult to use. This is likely because the
the code unintentionally exposes it&#39;s implementation. Sometimes the difficulty
in testing is hidden behind test helpers; where a more effective approach may be
to improve the interface of the component itself.</p>

<p>Long argument lists, callbacks, option hashes with required keys, and parameter
objects are all indicators of loose encapsulation. In many cases these are
completely reasonable; after all reducing the surface area of an interface
likely diminishes it&#39;s utility. In other cases, it&#39;s a sign the component may
be doing too much.</p>

<p>When we draw attention to codes encapsulation during review, it creates an
opportunity to simplify interfaces and decrease the cost of re-using the
component.</p>

<h3 id="cohesion-what-is-the-codes-job">Cohesion - What Is The Codes Job?</h3>

<p>The clearest example of non-cohesive code is a horror story from my youth.
There was a SQL query which had hardcoded values it would return in order to
change the color of a label. The argument could be made that this encapsulated
the behavior of the feature; but in doing so it mixed the responsibility of
retrieving data with the responsibility of presenting the data. Cohesive code
eschews additional responsibilities wherever it can; resulting in horizontal
layers and vertical slices.</p>

<p>By drawing attention to the cohesion of code we create opportunities to improve
clarity by grouping related functionality and un-grouping un-related
functionality. This un-related functionality may become either a collaborator or a
consumer of the component it was extracted from.</p>

<p>When we frame our code review in terms of clarity, coupling, encapsulation, and
cohesion we change the focus from the programmer and place it squarely on the
artifact. It also moves us out of the world of moral judgement such as what&#39;s
the &quot;best&quot; way to do something and into a conversation about the
tradeoffs that we make as we build a software system together.</p>

<h2 id="celebrate-intentionally">Celebrate Intentionally</h2>

<p>Despite our best intentions; no matter how well a code review goes it is still
a high pressure situation for the submitter. No matter how I try, I still feel
a bit sad when someone critiques my code. To counter the inevitable bummer of
critical feedback I try to comment on parts of the code that are of high quality
or teach me something. It can also help to use celebratory emoji.</p>

<p>The important part is to always be genuine in your celebration; as it is often
impossible to discern between sarcasm or mockery and genuine excitement or
positivity. Especially for people who struggle to value their own contributions
already.</p>

<h2 id="follow-up">Follow Up</h2>

<p>If there&#39;s valuable changes to be made from code review but the work was merged
already; it&#39;s OK to add the desired changes in your task or project tracking
system. I generally prefer that the team has sole discretion on when to
complete those tasks; as they&#39;ll have a better understanding of the cost of
delaying clean up as well as the impact that maintainability improvements will
have on short and long term goals.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, I believe a compassionate, critique-oriented code review practice
results in high quality code and allows companies to include team members who
struggle with pair or mob programming.</p>
